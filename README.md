## Discover My Journey üîç‚ú®

Explore my GitHub portfolio to discover a range of cybersecurity and machine learning projects. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.

## Cybersecurity Portfolio

**Description:** This comprehensive portfolio showcases a range of cybersecurity projects developed for simulated clients. The projects encompass various aspects of cybersecurity, including frameworks, audits, threat detection, and incident response.

**Key Components:**

1. **NIST Frameworks and Audits:** Implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity frameworks to establish robust security controls and conduct thorough audits.

2. **Linux and SQL Proficiency:** Utilization of Linux environments and SQL databases to manage and analyze security-related data effectively.

3. **Asset, Threat, and Vulnerability Management:** Identification and management of assets, assessment of potential threats, and evaluation of vulnerabilities to mitigate risks.

4. **Detection and Incident Response:** Deployment of tools like Wireshark and tcpdump for network analysis, and implementation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) such as Suricata. Development of incident response strategies, including escalation procedures.

5. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integration with SIEM platforms like Splunk and Chronicle to monitor and analyze security events in real-time.

6. **Python Automation:** Development of Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks, enhancing efficiency in security operations.

**Objective:** The primary goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate a holistic understanding of cybersecurity principles and the practical application of various tools and methodologies to protect digital assets.
