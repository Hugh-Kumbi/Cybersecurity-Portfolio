# Capturing a Packet with Tcpdump

## Scenario 

In this scenario, youâ€™re a network analyst who needs to use `tcpdump` to capture and analyze live network traffic from a Linux virtual machine.

The lab starts with your user account, called `analyst`, already logged in to a Linux terminal.

Your Linux user's home directory contains a sample packet capture file that you will use at the end of the lab to answer a few questions about the network traffic that it contains.
