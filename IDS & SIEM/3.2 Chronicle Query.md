After that I change the view of the interface to legacy view. Withing the legacy view I gleaned information from Virus Total (VT), and the IP address in question which is `40.100.174.34`.

After selectign `EXPAND ALL` to view detailed information about the HTTP requests, data including `GET` and `POST` requests were also provided. The `POST` request details are particularly significant, as they indicate that data was transmitted to the domain, potentially signaling a successful phishing attempt.
