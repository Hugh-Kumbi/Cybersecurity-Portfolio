# Guided Process

## Task 1 Perfom a Domain Search

In the search bar, I typed `signin.office365x24.com` and clicked Search. Under the DOMAINS, I clicked on `signin.office365x24.com` to complete the search.

![Domain Search 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c34f3cd9-a347-47d2-a5c0-b78dd8981a05)

Below is the result from the intial seearch:

After that I change the view of the interface to legacy view. Withing the legacy view I gleaned information from Virus Total (VT), and the IP address in question which is `40.100.174.34`.

## Task 3 Investigate the Threat Intelligence Data



## Task 4 Investigate the Affected Assests and Events



## Task 5 Investigate the Resolved IP Address


1. Launch Chronicle.
2. Perform a domain search.
* In the search bar, type `signin.office365x24.com` and click Search. Under `DOMAINS`, click signin.office365x24.com to complete the search. Below are the screenshots of the legacy view, VT, and IP address `40.100.174.34`.
