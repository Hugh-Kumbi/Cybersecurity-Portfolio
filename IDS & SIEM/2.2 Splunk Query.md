## Guided Process

> SIEM tools collect and process data, transforming it into searchable events that can be queried, analyzed, and visualized effectively.

## Task 1 - Task 3: 
* Create a Splunk Cloud Account
* Signup for a Free Splunk Cloud Trial
* Upload Data into Splunk

## Task 4: Perform a Basic Search

* Now that I've uploaded the data into Splunk, I'll perform my first query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and is searchable. 
* Navigating to the Search & Reporting tab and typing `index="main"` in the search bar to view repository for data.
> Adjusting the time using the time range dropdown or time modifiers to a shorter range returns results faster and uses fewer resources. In this instance I decided to select `All time` to view all the events across all time.

* The above search term specifies the index. An **index** is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.

## Task 5: Evaluate the Fields

Taking a closer look at three common components: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`.

![Three Components](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d525463f-de2c-4f6e-b571-92f29fb69ef4)

**Host:** Identifies the device or system responsible for generating the event.

**Source:** Refers to the original location of the event data within the device or system.

**Sourcetype:** Specifies the format and structure of the event data, guiding Splunk on how to parse and interpret it effectively.
