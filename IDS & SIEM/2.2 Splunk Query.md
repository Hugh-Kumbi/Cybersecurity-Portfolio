## Guided Process

> SIEM tools collect and process data, transforming it into searchable events that can be queried, analyzed, and visualized effectively.

## Task 1 - Task 3: 
* Create a Splunk Cloud Account
* Signup for a Free Splunk Cloud Trial
* Upload Data into Splunk

![Task 1 - Task 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/710f3489-4836-4154-8809-fd32fe96c361)


## Task 4: Perform a Basic Search
Take a moment to examine the Splunk Cloud interface by locating the app panel, the Explore Splunk panel, and the Splunk bar.

![Basic Search](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06de1e85-82df-49bd-9aed-2ecca6b98733)

Now that you've uploaded the data into Splunk, perform your first query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and is searchable. Follow these steps to perform a query:

1. Navigate to Splunk Home. (To return to Splunk Home, click the Splunk Cloud logo on the Splunk Cloud page.)
2. Click **Search & Reporting**. You may close any pop ups that appear.
3. In the search bar,  enter your search query:
**`index="main"`**
This search term specifies the index. An **index** is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.
4. Select **All Time** from the time range dropdown to search for all the events across all time.
5. Click the search button. Note that the search button is represented by the magnifying glass icon. Your search should retrieve thousands of events.

## Task 5: Evaluate the Fields
When Splunk indexes data, it attaches fields to each event. These fields become part of the searchable index event data. This helps security analysts easily search for and find the specific data they need. Now that you've run your first query, examine the search results and the fields.

For each event the fields are `host`, `source`, and `sourcetype`. Under **SELECTED FIELDS**, examine the same fields.

![Select Fields](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e45e776-3711-48a7-ac66-3e268a294265)

Examine the field values by clicking on the field under **SELECTED FIELDS**. You should observe the following:

* **host:** The host field specifies the name of the network host from which the event originated. In this search there are five hosts:

  * **`mailsv`** - Buttercup Games' mail server. Examine events generated from this host.

  * **`www1`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`www2`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`www3`** - This is one of Buttercup Games' web applications.

  * **`vendor_sales`** - Information about Buttercup Games' retail sales.

* **source:** The source field indicates the file name from which the event originates. You should identify eight sources. Notice **`/mailsv/secure.log`**, which is a log file that contains information related to authentication and authorization attempts on the mail server.

* **sourcetype:** The sourcetype determines how data is formatted. You should observe three sourcetypes. Examine **`secure-2`**.

## Task 6: Narrow your Search
Because you've been tasked with exploring any failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server, you'll need to narrow the search results for events from the mail server.

Under **SELECTED FIELDS**, click **host** and click **mailsv**.

Notice that a new term has been added to the search bar: **`index=main host=mailsv`**. The search results have narrowed to over 9000 events that are generated by the mail server.

## Task 7: Search for a Failed Login for Root
Now that you've narrowed your search results to events generated by the mail server, continue to narrow the search to locate any failed SSH logins for the **root** account. 

1. Clear the search bar.

2. Enter **`index=main host=mailsv fail* root`** into the search bar. This search expands on the search from the previous task and searches for the keyword **`fail*`**. The wildcard tells Splunk to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word *fail* such as *failure*, *failed*, etc. Lastly, the keyword **`root`** searches for any event that contains the term root.

Click **search**.

## Task 8: Evaluate the Search Results

Your search from the previous task should have retrieved search results for over 300 events. Navigate to other pages of the search results to observe the events not listed on the first page of results.

### Expectation
* Upload and process sample log data.
* Perform searches on indexed data.
* Analyze and evaluate search results.
* Identify and differentiate between various data sources.
* Detect failed SSH login attempts for the root account.

1. Login/signup to Splunk.
2. Add Data on the Splunk bar. 
3. Upload data into Splunk.
4. Select file and upload `tutorialdata.zip`. Please visit this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nDz_DZB4ADbD4tvaDa54_l1FoT_jtVy4/view) for further information.

5. Navigate to Search and Reporting tab, type on the search bar `index=main` to view repository for data and select `All time` to view all the events across all time. 
> Try to adjust the time using the time range dropdown or time modifiers. A shorter range returns results faster and uses fewer resources. In this scenario, I chose to display `all time`.

6. Let's have a look at three common components: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`.
* Host: Specifies the device or system that generated the event.
![chrome_Q6YdwxIlcN](https://github.com/Kwangsa19/Ketmanto-Cybersecurity-Portfolio/assets/135963482/c9c6196a-cc3c-453d-94a4-66eee93ee742)

* Source: Indicates the original location of the event data within a specific device or system.
![chrome_XzxWQfT9bW](https://github.com/Kwangsa19/Ketmanto-Cybersecurity-Portfolio/assets/135963482/6ba7447a-edd9-45ba-85a4-9dde1115ef7d)

* Sourcetype: Defines the format and structure of the event data. It tells Splunk how to parse and interpret the information.

7. On the mail server, we have to explore any failed SSH logins for the root account. To do this, I wrote on the search bar: `index=main host=mailsv' to list over 9000 events that are generated by the mail server. 
   
![chrome_IshPynvLLu](https://github.com/Kwangsa19/Ketmanto-Cybersecurity-Portfolio/assets/135963482/431476e8-a8e3-4cce-8791-6b89ec9867ae)

8. Finally, let's Search for a failed login for root. On the search bar, enter `index=main host=mailsv fail* root`. This tells Splunik to expand the search term to find other terms that contain the word `fail` such as `failure`, `failed`, etc. In addition, the keyword `root` searches for any event that contains the term `root`.

9. Investigation:
* There are over 100,000 events that are contained in the main index across `all time`.
* The `host` field specifies the name of a host, such as a network device or other system, from which an event originates.
* From the scenario, The `vendor_sales` host provides information about Buttercup Games' retail sales, such as the number of products sold.
* As of February 11th, 2024, there have been 346 failed SSH logins for the root account on the mail server.
