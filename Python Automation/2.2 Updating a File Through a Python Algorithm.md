# Updating a File Through a Python Algorithm

## Project Description

At my organization, access to restricted content is controlled with an allow list of IP addresses. The `"allow_list.txt"` file identifies these IP addresses. A separate remove list identifies IP addresses that should no longer have access to this content. I created an algorithm to automate updating the `"allow_list.txt"` file and remove these IP addresses that should no longer have access. 

## Open the File that Contains the Allow List

For the first part of the algorithm, I opened the "allow_list.txt" file. First, I assigned this file name as a string to the `import_file` variable:

![Assign import_file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c323ff28-1643-4609-85d7-9e6b5848a135)

Then, I used a with statement to open the file

![Build with Statement](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b082d2fb-2da2-4fdc-b8a1-1ff37e472f42)

In my algorithm, the `with` statement is used with the `.open()` function in read mode to open the allow list file for the purpose of reading it. The purpose of opening the file is to allow me to access the IP addresses stored in the allow list file. The `with` keyword will help manage the resources by closing the file after exiting the `with` statement. In the code `with` `open(import_file, "r") as file:`, the `open()` function has two parameters. The first identifies the file to import, and then the second indicates what I want to do with the file. In this case, `"r"` indicates that I want to read it. The code also uses the `as` keyword to assign a variable named `file`; `file` stores the output of the `.open()` function while I work within the `with` statement.

## Read the file contents

In order to read the file contents, I used the .read() method to convert it into the string.

![use read()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36a0a294-a329-45f7-b722-74be64a167ee)

When using an `.open()` function that includes the argument `"r"` for “read,” I can call the `.read()` function in the body of the `with statement`. The `.read()` method converts the file into a string and allows me to read it. I applied the `.read()` method to the `file` variable identified in the `with` statement. Then, I assigned the string output of this method to the variable `ip_addresses`. 

In summary, this code reads the contents of the `"allow_list.txt"` file into a string format that allows me to later use the string to organize and extract data in my Python program.
