# Activity Overview

In this activity, I will create a portfolio document to demonstrate my experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. 

## Scenario 

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

## Scenario Review

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

## Task 1

The file that you want to open is called **`"allow_list.txt"`**. Assign a string containing this file name to the **`import_file`** variable. Then, use a **`with`** statement to open it. Use the variable **`file`** to store the file while you work **`with`** it inside the with statement.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the **Open the file that contains the allow list** section of the **Algorithm for file updates in Python** template. In the **Task 2** section of **Create another algorithm** lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.
