# Activity Overview

In this activity, I will create a portfolio document to demonstrate my experience using Python to develop algorithms that involve opening files and parsing their contents. 

## Scenario 

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

## Task 1

The file that you want to open is called **`"allow_list.txt"`**. Assign a string containing this file name to the **`import_file`** variable. Then, use a **`with`** statement to open it. Use the variable **`file`** to store the file while you work **`with`** it inside the with statement.

Describe the Python syntax, functions, and keywords you need to accomplish this in the **Open the file that contains the allow list** section of the **Algorithm for file updates in Python** template. In the **Task 2** section of **Create another algorithm** lab, take a screenshot of this portion of your code. Or, type this code directly into the template.
