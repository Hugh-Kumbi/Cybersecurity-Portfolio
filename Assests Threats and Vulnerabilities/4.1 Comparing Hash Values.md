# Compare Hash Values

## Description
As a security analyst, one of the security controls we can implement is hashing. It produces a code that cannot be decrypted. It works by uniquely identifying the contents of a file, later
known as a unique identifier (hash value or digest). For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk.

## Generate Hashes
First, the ls command is used to list the files within the directory. Upon inspection, we observe two files, and their contents are displayed using the cat command. As shown in the image below, the contents of both files appear to be identical.

To determine whether the files are truly identical, we use the `sha256` command to calculate their hash values. As shown in the image below, the hash values for the two files are different, confirming they are not identical.

## Compare Hashes Files
We will generate the hash values of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and save them to new files named `file1hash` and `file2hash`, respectively.

Inspect the contents of `file1hash` and `file2hash` using the `cat` command. Finally, compare the two files using the `cmp` command to identify any differences.

## Summary
Although the contents of both files may appear identical, only their hash values can definitively determine whether they are truly the same.
