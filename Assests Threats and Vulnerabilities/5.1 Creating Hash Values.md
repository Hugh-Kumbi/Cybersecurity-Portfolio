# Creating Hash Values

## Scenario
As a security analyst, one of the security controls we can implement is hashing. A hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted. Hash functions are used to uniquely identify the contents of a file so that you can check whether it has been modified. This code provides a unique identifier known as a hash value or digest. For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk. Many tools are available to compare hashes for various scenarios. But for a security analyst it’s important to know how to manually compare hashes.

In this scenario, you need to investigate whether two files are identical or different. Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you’ll display the contents of two files and create hashes for each file. Next, you’ll examine the hashes and compare them.

## Generate hashes for files
*The lab starts in your home directory, `/home/analyst`, as the current working directory. This directory contains two files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, which contain same data.*

In this task, you need to display the contents of each of these files. You’ll then generate a hash value for each of these files and send the values to new files, which you’ll use to examine the differences in these values later.

* Use the ls command to list the contents of the directory.

Two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, are listed.

* Use the cat command to display the contents of the `file1.txt` file:

*Use the cat command to display the contents of the file2.txt file:

* Review the output of the two file contents:

**Note:** *The contents of the two files appear identical when you use the cat command to display the file contents.*

Although the contents of both files appear identical when you use the cat command, you need to generate the hash for each file to determine if the files are actually different. To determine whether the files are truly identical, we use the `sha256` command to calculate their hash values. 

* Use the sha256sum command to generate the hash of the `file1.txt` file:

You now need to follow the same step for the `file2.txt` file.

* Review the generated hashes of the contents of the two files:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a4719b0-956f-4bbb-ad2d-a4da88b1889c)

As shown in the image above, the generated hash value for file1.txt is different from the generated hash value for file2.txt, which indicates that the file contents are not identical.

## Compare Hashes
In this task, you’ll write the hashes to two separate files and then compare them to find the difference.

* Use the `sha256sum` command to generate the hash of the `file1.txt` file, and send the output to a new file called `file1hash`:

You now need to complete the same step for the `file2.txt` file.

* Use the `sha256sum` command to generate the hash of the `file2.txt` file, and send the output to a new file called `file2hash`:

![Picture18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe7f4775-2fea-4ae1-85cf-298dadbec890)

Now, you should have two hashes written to separate files. The first hash was written to the `file1hash` file, and the second hash was written to the `file2hash` file.

You can manually display and compare the differences.

* Use the cat command to display the hash values in the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files.

![Picture19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ae96c46-8a60-4f9c-bb31-262042157ea7)

Inspect the output and note the difference in the hash values.

**Note:** *Although the content in `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` previously appeared identical, the hashes written to the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files are completely different.*

Now, you can use the `cmp` command to compare the two files byte by byte. If a difference is found, the command reports the byte and line number where the first difference is found.

* Use the `cmp` command to highlight the differences in the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files:

![Picture20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f915e476-020b-41d0-9f9e-22cc586e06be)

Review the output, which reports the first difference between the two files:

![Picture21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/330600a9-7cd3-46df-a396-6a8f4152f5d3)

***Note:** The output of the `cmp` command indicates that the hashes differ at the first character in the first line.*

## Summary
Although the contents of both files may appear identical, only their hash values can definitively determine whether they are truly the same.
