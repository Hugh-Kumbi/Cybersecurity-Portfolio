# Creating Hash Values

## Scenario
As a security analyst, one of the security controls we can implement is hashing. A hash function is an algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted. Hash functions are used to uniquely identify the contents of a file so that you can check whether it has been modified. This code provides a unique identifier known as a hash value or digest. For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk. Many tools are available to compare hashes for various scenarios. But for a security analyst it’s important to know how to manually compare hashes.

In this scenario, you need to investigate whether two files are identical or different. Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you’ll display the contents of two files and create hashes for each file. Next, you’ll examine the hashes and compare them.

**Note:** *The lab starts in your home directory, /home/analyst, as the current working directory. This directory contains two files file1.txt and file2.txt, which contain same data.*

## Generate Hashes
First, the `ls` command is used to list the files within the directory. Upon inspection, we observe two files, and their contents are displayed using the `cat` command. As shown in the image below, the contents of both files appear to be identical.

To determine whether the files are truly identical, we use the `sha256` command to calculate their hash values. As shown in the image below, the hash values for the two files are different, confirming they are not identical.

## Compare Hashes Files
We will generate the hash values of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and save them to new files named `file1hash` and `file2hash`, respectively.

Inspect the contents of `file1hash` and `file2hash` using the `cat` command. Finally, compare the two files using the `cmp` command to identify any differences.

## Summary
Although the contents of both files may appear identical, only their hash values can definitively determine whether they are truly the same.
