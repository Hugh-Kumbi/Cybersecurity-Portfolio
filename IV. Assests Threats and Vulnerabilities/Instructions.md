## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

![Network devices](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8359b017-a3c6-4304-99a6-67b440457182)

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

* Desktop or laptop computers

* Smartphones

* Smart home devices

* Game consoles

* Storage devices or servers

* Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template

To use the template for this course item, click the link below and select Use Template. 

Link to template: [Home asset inventory](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Home%20Asset%20Inventory.xlsx)

### Step 2: Identify Assets

In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the **Asset** column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the **Asset** column.

***Note:** A few devices, like a network router, desktop, and a guest smartphone have already been added for your reference.*

### Step 3: Fill in the Characteristics of Each Asset

List important characteristics, including **Network access**, **Owner**, and **Location** for each asset that you’ve identified.

Here’s an explanation of each characteristic: 

* **Network access** describes how often the device is connected to the network.

* **Owner** describes the person responsible for the device.

* **Location** describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Access of Network Devices 

Review the information that you’ve listed in the **Network access**, **Owner**, and **Location** columns.

In the **Notes** column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:

* *What kind of information is stored on the device?*

* *How does it connect to the network?*

* *Is the owner careful about securing it?*

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.

***Note:** Keep in mind that there might be some variation within each category. Try to identify details that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information that’s connected to the network.*

## Step 5: Classify the Sensitivity of Network Devices

It’s time to classify assets based on the information you’ve collected. Do this by thinking about how an asset could impact your business if its security was compromised:

* *What types of information would be disclosed or stolen?*

* *Could an attacker alter information on the device?*

* *What would happen to the business if this information were destroyed?*

For example, the network router is classified as confidential because the owner has granted limited access to the device to specific users.

Find the **Sensitivity** column in the asset inventory. Type one of the four levels of sensitivity you previously learned about.

***Note:** You can use the Categories table as a guide for choosing an appropriate classification.*

### What to Include in Your Response 

Be sure to include the following elements in your completed activity: 

* List of 3 devices on the home network

* List network access, owner, and location for each device

* 1–2 notes on network access

* A sensitivity classification

# 2.1 Conducting a Risk Assessment for Business Operations   

> Please visit this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities?specialization=google-cybersecurity) for further information.

## Scenario 

You've joined a new cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. The team is conducting a risk assessment of the bank's current operational environment. As part of the assessment, they are creating a risk register to help them focus on securing the most vulnerable risks.

A **risk register** is a central record of potential risks to an organization's assets, information systems, and data. Security teams commonly use risk registers when conducting a risk assessment.

Your supervisor asks you to evaluate a set of risks that the cybersecurity team has recorded in the risk register. For each risk, you will first determine how likely that risk is to occur. Then, you will determine how severely that risk may impact the bank. Finally, you will calculate a score for the severity of that risk. You will then compare scores across all risks so your team can determine how to prioritize their attention for each risk.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the template
To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template. 

Link to template: [Risk register](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Risk%20Register.pdf)

### Step 2: Understand the Operating Environment

When conducting a risk assessment, it's important to consider the factors that could cause a security event. This often starts with understanding the operating environment.

In this scenario, your team has identified characteristics of the operating environment that could factor into the bank's risk profile:

*The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's data—100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.*

### Step 3:  Consider Potential Risks to Assets

Security events are possible when assets are at risk. The source of a risk can range from malicious attackers to accidental human errors. A risk source can even come from natural or environmental hazards, such as a structural failure or power outage.

The bank's funds are one of its key assets. Your team has listed five primary risks to the bank's funds:

* Business email compromise

* Compromised user database

* Financial records leak

* Theft

* Supply chain attack

Consider these potential risks in relation to the bank's operating environment. Then, write **2-3 sentences (40-60 words)** in the **Notes** area of the template describing how security events are possible considering the risks facing the funds in this operating environment.

### Step 4: Score Risks Based on their Likelihood

As you might recall, risk can be calculated with this simple formula:

**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

In order to calculate the score for a security risk, you must first estimate and score the likelihood of the risk causing a security event. The likelihood of a risk can be based on available evidence, prior experience, or expert judgment. A common way to estimate the likelihood of the risk is to determine the potential frequency of the risk occurring:

* *Could the risk happen once a day?*

* *Could the risk happen once a month?*

* *Could the risk happen once in a year?*

For example, the bank must have enough funds available each day to meet its legal requirements. A potential risk that could prevent the bank from replenishing its funds is a supply chain disruption. Being located in a coastal area, there's a likelihood that the bank may experience supply chain disruptions caused by hurricanes. However, a hurricane might only impact the bank every few years, so you can score the likelihood as low.

In this instance, the team is scoring the likelihood of an event on a scale of 1-3:

* **1** represents an event with a *low* chance of occuring.

* **2** represents an event with a *moderate* chance of occuring.

* **3** represents a *high* chance of occuring.

Review the **Risk(s)**, **Description**, and **Notes** of the risk register template. Refer to the risk matrix and use it to estimate a likelihood score for each risk. Then, enter a **score (1-3)** for each risk in the **Likelihood** column of the register.

### Step 5:  Score Risks Based on their Severity

A severity score is an estimate of the overall impact that might occur as a result of an event. For example, damage can occur to a company's reputation or finances and there may be a loss of data, customers, or assets. Evaluating the severity of a risk helps businesses determine the level of risk they can tolerate and how assets might be affected. 

When evaluating the severity of a risk, consider the potential consequences of that risk occurring:

* *How would the business be affected?*

* *What's the financial harm to the business and its customers?*

* *Can important operations or services be impacted?*

* *Are there regulations that can be violated?*

* *What is the reputational damage to the company's standing?*

Use the top row of the risk matrix and consider the potential impact of each risk. Estimate a severity score for each risk. Then, enter a **score (1-3)** for each risk in the **Severity** column of the register:

* **1** *(low severity)*

* **2** *(moderate severity)*

* **3** *(high severity)*

For example, a leak of financial records might lead to a loss of profits, a loss of customers, and heavy regulatory fines. A risk such as this might receive a severity score of 3 because it greatly impacts the bank's ability to operate.

### Step 6:  Calculate on Overall Risk Score

Ultimately, the goal of performing a risk assessment is to help security teams prioritize their efforts and resources.

Using the risk formula, multiply the likelihood and severity score for each risk. Then, enter a priority **score (1-9)** for each of the risks in the **Priority** column of the register.

### What to Include in Your Response 

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed activity: 

* 2-3 sentences describing the risk factors

* 5 likelihood scores

* 5 severity scores

* 5 overall risk scores

# 3.1 Determining Appropriate Data Handling Practices

> Please visit this [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities?specialization=google-cybersecurity) for further information.

## Scenario 

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template

To use the template for this course item, click the link and select Use Template.

Link to template: [Data leak worksheet](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Activity%20Template_%20Data%20leak%20worksheet.pdf)

### Step 2: Analyse the Situation

The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security control that helps maintain information privacy. However, least privilege starts to lose its effectiveness when too many users are given access to information. Data leaks commonly happen as information gets passed between people without oversight.

To start your analysis, review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor:

*A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. It contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a business partner during a sales call. Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the business partner received the link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.*

After reviewing the summary, write **20-60 words (2-3 sentences)** in the **Issue(s)** row of the Data leak worksheet describing the factors that led to the data leak.  

### Step 3:  Review Current Data Privacy Controls

Data leaks are a major risk due to the amount of data handled by the application. The company used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to develop their plan for addressing their information privacy concerns.

Review the **Security plan snapshot** resource of the worksheet. Then, review the **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6** resource of the worksheet.

After, write **20-60 words (2-3 sentences)** in the **Review** row of the Data leak worksheet to summarize what you've learned about NIST SP 800-53: AC-6.

### Step 4: Identify Control Enhancements

The company's implementation of least privilege is based on NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SP 800-53). NIST developed SP 800-53 to provide businesses with a customizable information privacy plan. It's a comprehensive resource that describes a wide range of control categories, including least privilege.

Use the **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6** resource to determine two control enhancements that might have prevented the data leak. List the **two improvements** in the **Recommendation(s)** row of the worksheet.

### Step 5: Justify Your Recommendations

At the end of your analysis, it's time to communicate your findings to your supervisor. It's important to justify your recommendations so that the supervisor can relay this information to other decision makers at the company.

Consider the issues you identified earlier. Then, write **20-60 words (2-3 sentences)** in the **Justification** row describing why you think the control enhancements you recommend will reduce the likelihood of another data leak.

### What to Include in Your Response 

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity: 

* 2-3 sentences analyzing the factors that led to the incident

* 2-3 sentences summarizing NIST SP 800-53: AC-6

* 2 control enhancement recommendations to improve least privilege 

* 2-3 sentences justifying your recommendations

# 7.1 Conducting a Vulnerability Assessment 

## Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Part 1: Open a Report Template

### Step 1: Access the template
Use the following template to construct your written report. 

To use the template for this course item:

Click the following link and select Use Template: [Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability%20Assessment%20Report.pdf)

### Step 2: Access supporting materials
The following materials will help you complete this activity. Keep them open as you proceed to the next steps. You will use this resource in Part 2 of this activity.

To use the supporting materials for this course item:

Click the following link and select *Use Template:* [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/NIST%20SP%20800-30%20Rev.%201.pdf)

### Step 3: Review Information About the Vulnerable Server

In this activity, we have provided you with the **System Description** and **Scope** of the *[Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability%20Assessment%20Report.pdf)* in the template provided. Vulnerability assessments include a description of the system being evaluated and the scope of the project.

Review the **System Description** and **Scope** of the *[Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability%20Assessment%20Report.pdf)*.

The **System Description** highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system.

The **Scope** specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the server — not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.

### Part 2: Perform the Risk Assessment

### Step 1: Explain the Purpose of the Information System

Use the [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/NIST%20SP%20800-30%20Rev.%201.pdf) resource to complete this activity.

Once you have reviewed  the  system description and scope, you will write  a purpose statement. The purpose section helps stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of your analysis. A purpose statement also connects the technical objectives of your analysis with the organization's goals.

Consider what you know about the server:

* *How is the database server valuable to the business?*

* *Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?*

* *How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?*

In the **Purpose** section of the report, use the questions provided and write **3-5 sentences** (60-100 words) describing the reason(s) for conducting this vulnerability analysis.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Threat Sources

Explore the *Threat sources* section of the *[NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/NIST%20SP%20800-30%20Rev.%201.pdf)* resource. Using what you know about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described.

In the **Threat Source** column of the Risk Assessment table of your template, **identify three** potential threats. Choose the threats based on the information you have gathered from the system description, scope, purpose, and *[NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/NIST%20SP%20800-30%20Rev.%201.pdf)* resource.

### Step 3: Identify Potential Threat Events

*[NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/NIST%20SP%20800-30%20Rev.%201.pdf)* provides a comprehensive list of possible security events that could compromise a vulnerable information system — labeled *Threat events*. This list covers what attackers from different groups typically try to achieve and how good they are at it. For example, a business competitor might have the technical capabilities needed to conduct a denial of service attack.

Explore the *Threat events* section in the resource. Then, **identify three** threat events that could be initiated based on the threat sources you identified. Write the three threat events in the **Threat Event** column of the Risk Assessment table in your template.

### Step 4: Calculate the Risk of Potential Threats

You may recall from an earlier reading about [Calculating Risk](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Calculating%20Risks.pdf) that potential threats and vulnerabilities are important factors to think about when evaluating the security of an asset.
 
Refer to the likelihood and severity sections of the *NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1* resource and ask yourself the following questions about each threat that you identified earlier:

* *How frequently could this happen?*

* *Would critical business functions be impacted?*

* *How might this affect the business and its customers?*

Then, estimate a **Likelihood** score (1-3) and **Severity** score (1-3) for each threat and add your scores to the corresponding columns of the Risk Assessment table in your template. After that, calculate an overall **Risk** score (1-9) for each threat using the formula (**likelihood x severity = ris*k**).

**Note:** The number of rows in a risk table can vary depending on the complexity and scope of the assessment. In general, it should provide stakeholders with a comprehensive overview of all significant risks.

### Part 3: Propose Security Recommendations

### Step 1: Explain Your Approach

Another section that's commonly included in a vulnerability assessment is an explanation of your approach. This helps stakeholders understand your thought process of evaluating the risks you've identified — adding valuable context for stakeholders.

You are conducting a *qualitative* vulnerability assessment, which relies on subjective judgment to assess the likelihood and severity of risks. Your task here is to estimate how bad attacks could be by judging their chances based on your security knowledge. Qualitative vulnerability assessments are useful for identifying high-level risks facing an organization. This information helps organizations make informed decisions about resource allocation, project planning, and other aspects of their business operations.

In the **Approach** section of your template, write **3-5 sentence** (60-100 words) explaining why you selected the 3 specific threat sources/events you chose and why you think they're significant business risks.

### Step 2: Propose a Remediation Strategy

After performing a vulnerability assessment, creating a well-defined remediation strategy is crucial for protecting your systems and data.  The remediation strategy should provide stakeholders with actionable steps that can be taken to remediate, or fix, vulnerabilities to avoid threats.

**Note:** Certain threats cannot be fixed. In those cases, it's equally important to consider a *mitigation strategy* — a plan to reduce the severity of a threat.

Think about the risks that could remediate and/or mitigate using security controls like:

* Principle of least privilege 

* Defense in depth

* Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

* Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) framework

In the **Remediation** section of the template, write **3-5 sentences** (60-100 words) summarizing specific security controls that could be implemented to remediate or mitigate the risks to the information system.

Align your suggestions with the risks you've assessed. For example, you might suggest public key infrastructure (PKI) to address exfiltration of sensitive information. 

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity: 

* 3-5 sentences describing the reasons for conducting the security analysis in the **Purpose** section

* A completed **Risk Assessment** section

* 3-5 sentences explaining your reasoning for the identified risks in the **Approach** section

* 3-5 sentences summarizing a *remediation and/or mitigation* strategy in the **Remediation** section

# 8.1 Identify the attack vectors of a USB drive

## Scenario

You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. There’s no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used for this very purpose because it’s one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The  software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn’t connected to other files or networks, so the USB drive can’t affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.

## Step-By-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access the Template
To use the template for this course item, click the link and select Use Template. 

Link to template: [Parking Lot USB Exercise](https://github.com/Hugh-Kumbi/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/IV.%20Assests%20Threats%20and%20Vulnerabilities/Parking%20Lot%20USB%20Exercise.pdf)

### Step 2: Inspect the Contents of the USB Stick

You create a virtual environment and plug the USB drive into the workstation. The contents of the device appear to belong to Jorge Bailey, the human resource manager at Rhetorical Hospital.

Jorge's drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files. For example, it contains folders that appear to store family and pet photos. There is also a new hire letter and an employee shift schedule.

Review the types of information that Jorge has stored on this device. Then, in the **Contents** row of the activity template, write **2-3 sentences** (40-60 words) about the type of information that's stored on the USB drive.

***Note:** USB drives often contain an assortment of personally identifiable information (PII). Attackers can easily use this sensitive information to target the data owner or others around them.*

### Step 3: Apply an Attacker Mindset to the Contents of the USB Drive

The flash drive appears to contain a mixture of personal and work-related files. Consider how an attacker might use this information if they obtained it. Also, consider whether this whole event was staged.

For example, an attacker could have placed these files on the USB drive as a distraction. They might have targeted Jorge or someone he knows, hoping they would find the device and plug it into their workstation. In doing so, the attacker could establish a backdoor into the company's systems while the unsuspecting target browsed through the files.

In the **Attacker mindset** row of the activity template, write **2-3 sentences** (40-60 words) about how this information could be used against Jorge or the hospital.

***Pro tip:** The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) provides some [security tips on using caution with USB drives](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/using-caution-usb-drives), including keeping personal and business drives separate.*

### Step 4: Analyse the Risk of Finding a Parking Lot USB

You have *not* opened any of the files on the device, which is best practice. 

Attackers sometimes conduct USB baiting attacks to deliver malicious code that they've crafted.

However, this USB drive was still a security risk even though it did not contain malicious code. It could have easily been found by an attacker who might have used its contents to plan a variety of attacks.

Consider some of the risks associated with USB baiting attacks:

* What types of malicious software could be hidden on these devices? What could have happened if the device were infected and discovered by another employee?

* What sensitive information could a threat actor find on a device like this?

* How might that information be used against an individual or an organization?

In the **Risk analysis** row of the activity template, write **3 or 4** sentences (60-80 words) describing any technical, operational, or managerial controls that could mitigate USB baiting attacks.

### What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed activity: 

* 2-3 sentences about the types of information stored on the USB drive

* 2-3 sentences about how the information could be used against the owner and/or organization

* 3-4 sentences analyzing the risks of USB baiting attacks
