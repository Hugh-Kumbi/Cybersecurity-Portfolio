# Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Managing Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to managing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. It highlights the importance of implementing security controls and adopting a threat actor mindset to safeguard an organizationâ€™s assets against risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

## Contents
1.1  **Classifying Assets on a Home Network**
- In this activity, I classified assets connected to a home office network. I began by creating an asset inventory, cataloging all assets that require protection. Using asset management principles, I then classified these assets based on their importance and sensitivity to potential risks. This foundational task is essential for understanding and mitigating threats to critical resources. Completing this activity helped me strengthen my skills in asset management, a crucial aspect of any organization's security plan.
  
2.1  **Conducting a Risk Assessment for Business Operations**
- In this activity, I conducted a risk assessment by evaluating vulnerabilities that commonly threaten business operations. Using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as a guide, I identified potential risks and assigned risk scores to each vulnerability to prioritize resource allocation effectively. This process allowed me to assess the readiness of security operations to prevent cyberattacks and protect sensitive information. Completing this task reinforced my understanding of proactive risk management, a critical component of an organization's security plan.

3.1  **Reviewing a Data Risk Assessment**
- In this activity, I reviewed the results of a data risk assessment to evaluate whether effective data handling processes were being implemented to protect information privacy. I analyzed the application of technical, operational, and managerial controls, focusing on the principle of least privilege as a key strategy for safeguarding sensitive data. This task highlighted the importance of protecting diverse assets, from intellectual property to network access, and reinforced best practices in data protection and privacy management.

4.1  **Exploring Cryptography: Decrypting Files and Revealing Hidden Messages**
- In this lab activity, I applied my knowledge of cryptography to secure and analyze data online. Using Linux commands, I performed basic cryptographic tasks, including decrypting files and uncovering hidden messages. This activity built on my understanding of encryption and decryption, which are essential tools for protecting information privacy. It also deepened my familiarity with foundational cryptographic techniques, such as the Caesar cipher, and reinforced the importance of implementing effective security controls to safeguard sensitive data.

5.1  **Comparing Hash Values: Identifying File Modifications**
- In this lab activity, I explored the use of hash functions to ensure file integrity and detect potential threats. By using Linux commands, I generated hash values for two files and manually compared them to identify differences. This hands-on approach emphasized the importance of hashing as a security control, as hash values serve as unique identifiers for files. It also highlighted how modifications, such as those in malicious programs, can be detected by comparing hash values. This lab reinforced my ability to use hashing to protect organizations against threats and maintain data integrity.

6.1  **Evaluating and Improving Access Controls**
- In this activity, I evaluated the access controls implemented by a business to manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. I analyzed their current processes, identified potential security issues, and recommended improvements to enhance their security practices. This included distinguishing between authentication controls, which verify user identities, and authorization controls, which define user permissions and restrictions. By addressing gaps in access controls, I contributed to reducing the likelihood of security risks and ensuring robust protection of sensitive information.
