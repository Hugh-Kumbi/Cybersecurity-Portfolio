# Decrypting an Encrypted Message

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Read the Contents of a File 

1. I used the `ls` command to list the files in the directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls /home/analyst`:

**Note:** Two files, `Q1.encrypted` and `README.txt`, and a subdirectory, `caesar`, are listed:

**The `README.txt` file contains an important message with instructions I need to follow.**

2. I then used the `cat` command to list the contents of the `README.txt` file.
    * The command to complete this step is `cat README.txt`:

This will display the following output:

***Note:** The message in the `README.txt` file advises that the `caesar` subdirectory contains a hidden file.*

### Task 2. Find a Hidden File

1. Firstly, I used the `cd` command to change to the `caesar` subdirectory of my home directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `cd caesar`:

2. Secondly, I used the `ls -a` command to list all files, including hidden files, in my home directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls -a`:

![Picture4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbcfd96-f92b-410d-acbd-7160a3766362)

This will display the following output:

**Note:** Hidden files in Linux can be identified by their name starting with a period (`.`).

3. I then used the `cat` command to list the contents of the hidden file.
    * The command to complete this step is `cat .leftShift3`:

![Picture5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f1e0e8-487c-4baa-b682-e80b69b77f55)

The message in the `.leftShift3` file appears to be scrambled. This is because the data has been encrypted using a Caesar cipher. This cipher can be solved by shifting each alphabet character to the left or right by a fixed number of spaces. In this example, the shift is three letters to the left. Thus "d" stands for "a", and "e" stands for "b".

4. Given that the message in the `.leftShift3` file is scrambled, I solved the Cipher using the `cat` and `tr` command.
    * The command to complete this step is `cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"`:

**Note:** *The `tr` command translates text from one set of characters to another, using a mapping. The first parameter to the `tr` command represents the input set of characters, and the second represents the output set of characters. Hence, if you provide parameters “abcd” and “pqrs”, and the input string to the `tr` command is “ac”, the output string will be “pr".*

This will display the following output:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0f8e7c-0f7d-44ca-9171-2bc557369fc9)

In this case, the command `tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"` translates all the lowercase and uppercase letters in the alphabet back to their original position. The first character set, indicated by `"d-za-cD-ZA-C"`, is translated to the second character set, which is `"a-zA-Z"`.

At this moment, I had to return to my home directory before completing the next task:

### Task 3. Decrypt a File

1. After solving the Caesar cipher I needed to use the command revealed in `.leftshift3` to decrypt the file and recover my data so I can read the message it contains.           * The command to return to the initial working directory is`openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute`:

![Picture8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9a377ad-c62b-4aeb-97e8-f9d26d877dfe)

In this instance, the `openssl` command reverses the encryption of the file with a secure symmetric cipher, as indicated by `AES-256-CBC`. The `-pbkdf2` option is used to add extra security to the key, and `-a` indicates the desired encoding for the output. The `-d` indicates decrypting, while `-in` specifies the input file and `-out` specifies the output file. The `-k` specifies the password, which in this example is `ettubrute.`

2. I then used the `ls` command to list the contents of your current working directory again.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls`:

**Note:** The new file `Q1.recovered` in the directory listing is the decrypted file and contains a message.

3. After that I used the `cat` command to list the contents of the `Q1.recovered file`.
    * The command to complete this step is cat Q1.recovered:

This will display the following output:
