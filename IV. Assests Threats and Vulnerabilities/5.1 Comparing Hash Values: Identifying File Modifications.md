# Comparing Hash Values: Identifying File Modifications

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Generate Hashes for Files

1. I listed the contents of the directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls`:

**Two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, are listed.**

2. I then displayed the contents of the `file1.txt` file.
      * The command to complete this step is `cat file1.txt`:

3. After that I displayed the contents of the ` file2.txt file.
    * The command to complete this step is `cat file2.txt`:

4. A review of the output of the two file contents:

**Note:** *The contents of the two files appear identical when you use the cat command to display the file contents.*

Although the contents of both files appear identical when I used the `cat` command, I still needed to generate the hash for each file to determine if the files were actually different. To determine whether the files were truly identical, I used the `sha256` command to calculate their hash values. 

5. I generated the hash of the `file1.txt` file using the sha256sum command.
    * The command to complete this step is `sha256sum file1.txt`:

6. I generated the hash of the `file2.txt` file using the sha256sum command.
    * The command to complete this step is `sha256sum file2.txt`:

7. A review of the generated hashes of the contents of the two files:

***Note:** As shown in the image above, the generated hash value for `file1.txt` is different from the generated hash value for `file2.txt`, which indicates that the file contents are not identical.*

### Task 2. Compare Hashes

1. I used the `sha256sum` command to generate the hash of the `file1.txt` file, and send the output to a new file called `file1hash`
    * The command to complete this step is `sha256sum file1.txt >> file1hash`:

![Picture27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bbff2b5-22e9-4574-a251-b65dbd7be80e)

You now need to complete the same step for the `file2.txt` file.

2. I then used the `sha256sum` command to generate the hash of the `file2.txt` file, and send the output to a new file called `file2hash`:
    * The command to complete this step is `sha256sum file2.txt >> file2hash`:

![Picture28](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4988cccc-0a8e-4074-b113-1dcafe2836b8)

***Note:** After completing the above steps I had two hashes written to separate files. The first hash was written to the `file1hash` file, and the second hash was written to the `file2hash` file.*

3. I then moved on to manually display and compare the differences. First I used the `cat` command to display the hash values in the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files.
    * The command to complete this step is `cat file1hash
cat file2hash`:

![Picture29](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bcdf6e-f89e-4709-ae0a-1a52590d9d15)

**Once that was done, I inspected the output in order to note the difference in the hash values.**

**Note:** *Although the content in `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` previously appeared identical, the hashes written to the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files are completely different.*

If a difference is found, the command reports the byte and line number where the first difference is found.

4. I then decided to use the `cmp` command to highlight the differences in the `file1hash` and `file2hash` files byte by byte.
    * The command to complete this step is `cmp file1hash file2hash`:

![Picture30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90e8be34-67bc-4f7d-bb9e-f55e35ca01b8)

After reviewing the output, a difference was found. The command reported the byte and line number where the first difference wass found:

![Picture31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/625a183e-4fa7-4af6-8c3e-6a98000569ab)

***Note:** The output of the `cmp` command indicated that the hashes differ at the first character in the first line.*

## Summary

Although the contents of both files may appear identical, only their hash values can definitively determine whether they are truly the same.

### Outcomes

As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in:
* Computing hashes using sha256sum.
* Displaying hashes using the cat command.
* Comparing hashes using the cmp command.
These are valuable tools I can use to validate data integrity and contribute to enhancing my organizationâ€™s security.
