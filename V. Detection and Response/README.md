# Cybersecurity in Action: Detection and Response

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to managing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. It emphasizes understanding the incident response lifecycle and developing practical skills to use tools for detecting and responding to cybersecurity incidents effectively.

## Contents
1.1  **Documenting Security Incidents in an Incident Handler's Journal**

- In this activity, I reviewed the details of a security incident and documented the findings using an incident handler's journal. This exercise emphasized the critical role of documentation in the incident response process.

I practiced recording key information about the incident, including timelines, actions taken, and outcomes. Maintaining an accurate and detailed incident handler's journal is essential for analyzing and responding to security incidents effectively. It also serves as a valuable resource for learning and improving future incident response processes.
