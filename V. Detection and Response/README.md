# Cybersecurity in Action: Detection and Response

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to managing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. It emphasizes understanding the incident response lifecycle and developing practical skills to use tools for detecting and responding to cybersecurity incidents effectively.

## Contents

1.1  **Documenting Security Incidents in an Incident Handler's Journal**

- In this activity, I reviewed the details of a security incident and documented the findings using an incident handler's journal. This exercise emphasized the critical role of documentation in the incident response process.

I practiced recording key information about the incident, including timelines, actions taken, and outcomes. Maintaining an accurate and detailed incident handler's journal is essential for analyzing and responding to security incidents effectively. It also serves as a valuable resource for learning and improving future incident response processes.

2.1  **Exploring Network Protocol Analyzers: Wireshark and Tcpdump**

- In this activity, I explored the functionalities of two powerful network protocol analyzers: Wireshark and tcpdump.

I gained a foundational understanding of how these tools work and their key features. By using these packet sniffers, I learned how to capture and analyze network traffic, a critical skill for security analysts. These tools enable the examination of network traffic flows, aiding in identifying patterns and investigating potential security issues within a network.

1.3  **Analyzing Artifacts with VirusTotal and the Pyramid of Pain**

- This activity involved using VirusTotal to analyze a suspicious artifact and identifying its associated indicators of compromise (IoCs). I applied the Pyramid of Pain framework to understand the value and persistence of these IoCs for security analysis. By leveraging VirusTotal's crowdsourced intelligence and the insights from the Pyramid of Pain, I gained practical experience in threat intelligence analysis and improved my understanding of how to enhance security posture.

4.1  **Responding to a Phishing Incident with a Playbook**

- This activity involves responding to a phishing incident involving a malicious file hash that was previously identified in **Analyzing Artifacts with VirusTotal and the Pyramid of Pain**. I utilized a playbook to guide my investigation and resolution of the incident alert ticket. By following the playbook's instructions, I gained practical experience in applying a structured approach to incident response, minimizing the impact of the incident and improving my overall incident response capabilities.

5.1  **Security Incident Report: Data Breach via Forced Browsing Attack**
- In this activity, I reviewed an example of a final report. I had previously learned about the Post-incident Activity phase within the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle, which emphasizes the critical role of documentation in the form of a final report.

By carefully examining the provided final report, I demonstrated my understanding of the essential elements of a comprehensive incident report. These elements include a detailed timeline of events, a summary of actions taken during the incident response, and recommendations for improving future incident response capabilities.

This activity provided valuable insights into the importance of thorough documentation in the post-incident activity phase. Through this analysis, I strengthened my understanding of how to effectively contribute to post-incident activities and enhance future incident response efforts within an organization.
