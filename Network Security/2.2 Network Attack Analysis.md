# Network Attack Analysis

## Identify the Type of Attack That May Have Caused This Network Interruption 

* One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is: DOS attack <br>
* The logs show that: Web server stops responding after receiving so many SYN packet requests <br>
* This event could be: Syn flood attack

## Part 2: Explain How the Attack is Causing the Website Malfunction 
When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol. Explain the three steps of the handshake: 

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | `SYN` : Client sends SYN packet to the server, requesting a connection. |
| 2 | `SYN/ACK` : Server responds with SYN/ACK packet, acknowledging the client's SYN and requesting confirmation of the connection. |
| 3 | `ACK` : Client sends ACK packet to the server, acknowledging the server's SYN/ACK. |

* Explain what happens when a malicious actor sends a large number of SYN packets all at once: It slows down the traffic to the point where such request will fail to be executed. It overwhelms the serverâ€™s available resources to reserve for the connection. When this happens, there are no server resources left for legitimate TCP connection requests. <br>
* Explain what the logs indicate and how that affects the server: The server has become overloaded and unable to receive any more visitors. In addition, those new visitors will receive a connection timeout message.
