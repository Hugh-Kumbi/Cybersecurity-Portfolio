## Guided Process

> SIEM tools collect and process data, transforming it into searchable events that can be queried, analyzed, and visualized effectively.

## Proposed Resolution

### Step 1 - Step 4: 
* Accessed supporting materials
* Created a Splunk Cloud Account
* Signed-up for a Free Splunk Cloud Trial
* Uploaded Data into Splunk

### Step 4: Performing a Basic Search

* Now that I had uploaded the data into Splunk, I performed a query to confirm that the data has been ingested, indexed, and was searchable. 
* I then navigated to the **Search & Reporting** tab and typed `index="main"` in the search bar to view repository for data.

> After that I adjusted the time using the time range dropdown or time modifiers to a shorter range because that returns results faster and uses fewer resources. In this instance I decided to select `All time` to view all the events across all time.

* The above search term specifies the index. An **index** is a repository for data. Here, the index is a single dataset containing events from an index named main.

### Step 5: Evaluating the Fields

Taking a closer look at three common components: `host`, `source`, `sourcetype`.

![Three Components](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d525463f-de2c-4f6e-b571-92f29fb69ef4)

**Host:** Identifies the device or system responsible for generating the event.

![Host](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51051b74-115d-40da-a357-0f60645332d0)

**Source:** Refers to the original location of the event data within the device or system.

![Source](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd9de02-1e30-4474-8ea2-ad837cb04ea1)

**Sourcetype:** Specifies the format and structure of the event data, guiding Splunk on how to parse and interpret it effectively.

### Step 6: Narrowing the Search

On the mail server, I investigated failed `SSH login` attempts for the root account. To begin, I entered `index=main host=mailsv` into the search bar, which returned over `9,000` events generated by the mail server.

### Step 7: Searching for a Failed Login for Root

Next, I searched specifically for failed login attempts for the root account. In the search bar, I entered:
`index=main host=mailsv fail* root`
* The above query instructed Splunk to look for events where the term `fail` appears in any variation, such as `failure` or `failed,` by using the wildcard `*`. Additionally, the keyword `root` filtered the results to include only events that mention the root account.

### Step 8: Evaluating the Search Result

* The `main index` contained over `100,000` events spanning `all time`.
* The `host` field identified the originating system or network device associated with an event. For example, in this scenario, the `vendor_sales` host provided data related to Buttercup Games' retail sales, including the number of products sold.
* As of `November 1st, 2024`, the `mailsv host` recorded `346` failed `SSH login` attempts for the root account on the mail server.

### Outcomes and Skills Gained

**As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in using Splunk Cloud to:**

  * Successfully upload and process sample log data in the system.
  * Perform searches on indexed data to retrieve relevant events with proficiency.
  * Analyze and interpret search results effectively.
  * Identify and distinguish between various data sources based on their origin and content.
  * Detect and investigate failed SSH login attempts for the root account, enhancing my event analysis capabilities.

These skills are essential for conducting thorough and efficient searches and investigations using Splunk Cloud.
