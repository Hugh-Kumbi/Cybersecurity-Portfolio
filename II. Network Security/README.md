# Network Security Analysis: Safeguarding Digital Ecosystems

This folder contains exercises, solutions and supporting materials related to Network Security, showcasing skills in dealing with network-level vulnerabilities, cloud and network security as well as how to secure networks.

## Contents

1.1 **Analyzing Network Layer Communication**

- In this activity, I analyzed DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data captured from a network protocol analyzer tool. Through careful examination, I identified the specific network protocol utilized in the assessment of a cybersecurity incident. This process allowed me to gain insights into the nature of the incident and the role of these protocols in the broader context of network security.
  
2.1 **Network Attack Incident**

- In this project, I tackled a scenario where a customer of the company I work for experienced a security issue while accessing the company's website. I identified the likely cause of the service interruption, analyzed how the attack occurred, and detailed the negative impact it had on the website's functionality and user trust. This hands-on analysis allowed me to demonstrate my ability to investigate network security issues and communicate findings effectively.

3.1 **Security Incident Investigation**

- In this activity, I took on the role of a cybersecurity analyst for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. When visitors attempted to load the main webpage, they encountered a security issue. My task was to investigate the problem, identify the root cause, document the findings, and recommend a solution to resolve the security issue. This involved analyzing traffic, examining potential vulnerabilities, and proposing steps to safeguard the website against similar incidents in the future.

4.1 **Security Risk Incident**

- In this activity, I reviewed a scenario involving a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address this breach, I focused on identifying common network hardening tools that could enhance the organization’s overall security. I then selected a specific vulnerability within the company’s network and proposed several network hardening methods to mitigate it. Finally, I explained how these methods and tools would be effective in managing the vulnerability, preventing future breaches, and strengthening the organization's defenses against potential cyberattacks.

5.1 **NIST CSF Incident**

- In this activity, I created an incident report by analyzing a network security incident through the lens of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The NIST CSF is a voluntary framework comprising standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. I applied the CSF to break down the incident, identify potential vulnerabilities, and assess the response actions taken. By developing a thorough cybersecurity incident report and integrating the CSF, I was able to demonstrate a proactive approach to security, improve communication and transparency with stakeholders, and enhance overall security practices within the organization. This incident report can also be included in my cybersecurity portfolio as a key example of my ability to handle security incidents professionally.
