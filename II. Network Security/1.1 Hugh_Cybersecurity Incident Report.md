# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Network Traffic Analysis 

## Part 1: A Summary of the Problem Found in the Tcpdump Log
* The issue with the UDP protocol reveals that a client computer attempting to access the website encountered an error due to the DNS server's failure to properly translate the URL into an IP address. This resulted in the website being inaccessible. <br>
* Network analysis logs confirm this issue, showing that the ICMP protocol responded with an error message, “udp port 53 unreachable.” Port 53 is associated with DNS traffic, indicating a problem with the DNS server. <br>
* Further details from the logs show that the outgoing UDP message contained query identification flags, including a + symbol, which signals potential issues with the message. Additionally, the A? symbol indicates that there was a problem performing DNS protocol operations to resolve the domain name. <br> 
* This evidence strongly suggests that the DNS server is unresponsive. The most likely reason for the error is an overload of requests to the DNS server, preventing the UDP protocol from transitioning to TCP. If the transition had occurred, port 443 would have been used to secure communication between clients and the web server. <br> 

## Part 2: Explaining my Analysis of the Data and Providing Causes of the Incident

**Time of Incident:** 
* The incident occurred at 1:24:32.192571.
  
**An Explanation of how the IT Team Became Aware of the Incident:**
* Several customers reported being unable to access the website www.yummyrecipesforme.com. After waiting for the page to load, they received the error message “destination port unreachable.”
  
**An Explanation of the Actions Taken by the IT Department to Investigate the Incident:**
The IT team attempted to access the website and observed the same error message, “destination port unreachable.” Using the tcpdump network analysis tool, the team conducted packet sniffing tests while attempting to load the webpage. The issue was escalated to IT security engineers for further investigation, and the problem was reported to the team supervisor.

**Key Findings of the IT Department's Investigation:** 
The DNS server returned an undesired response when translating the URL into an IP address. The UDP protocol, used to contact the DNS server, generated an ICMP error response, “udp port 53 unreachable.” This indicates that port 53, associated with DNS traffic, was unresponsive. Flags in the UDP message provided further evidence of DNS protocol issues. Specifically, the + symbol indicated flagged query identification, and the A? symbol highlighted problems resolving the domain name.

**Likely Causes of the Incident:**
* A high volume of requests overloaded the DNS server.
* A Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
* Misconfiguration or failure of the DNS server.
* The possibility that traffic to port 53 was blocked by the firewall.
