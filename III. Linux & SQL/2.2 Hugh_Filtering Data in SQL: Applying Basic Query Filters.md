# Filtering an SQL Query

## Proposed Resolution

# Task 1. List all organization machines

* I rann an SQL query to retrieve only the `device_id` and `operating_system` columns from the `machines` table.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT device_id, operating_system 
FROM machines;`:


![SELECT device_id, operating_system FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/884b6e91-8e3a-455e-9b68-d2de9410f5c3)


# Task 2. Retrieve a list of the machines with OS 2

![SELECT device_id, operating_system FROM machines WHERE operating_system = 'OS 2';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1960219d-89e9-48d4-bc57-3b3c4541d67d)


# Task 3. List employees in specific departments

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e24c8f-8aef-407c-9072-61d68a4fd491)

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288396c0-aa13-4cb8-8a1e-75bac3e333e1)

# Task 4. Identify employee machines

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE office = 'South-109';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63860ba0-f558-498a-8a03-90d57a6bb150)

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE office LIKE 'South%';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fccbd7-f994-4f68-b610-b41e3ce7e00b)


Conclusion
Great work!

You now have practical experience in using SQL to

apply the WHERE clause to filter what a SQL query returns and
use the LIKE operator to filter for patterns.
Youâ€™re well on your way to running SQL queries to get specific data from a database.
