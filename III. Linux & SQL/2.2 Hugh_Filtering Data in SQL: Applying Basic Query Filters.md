# Filtering Data in SQL: Applying Basic Query Filters

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. List all organization machines

* I ran an SQL query to retrieve only the `device_id` and `operating_system` columns from the `machines` table because I needed to get a list of all organization machines and their operating systems.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT device_id, operating_system 
FROM machines;`.

The output lists only the selected columns from all the rows in the machines table:

![SELECT device_id, operating_system FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/884b6e91-8e3a-455e-9b68-d2de9410f5c3)

***Note:**  The `machines` table above returned 200 rows.*

### Task 2. Retrieve a list of the machines with OS 2

* I selected all the records from the `machines` table with a value of `'OS 2'` in the `operating_system` column given that I needed to obtain a list of all machines with the `'OS 2'` operating system because these machines need an update.
  * The command to complete this step is `SELECT device_id, operating_system 
FROM machines 
WHERE operating_system = 'OS 2';`.

The output displays the selected columns of the `machines` table, filtered by the operating system:

![SELECT device_id, operating_system FROM machines WHERE operating_system = 'OS 2';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1960219d-89e9-48d4-bc57-3b3c4541d67d)

***Note:** The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter the results returned by a query by returning only the records that satisfy the condition. There are 80 `machines` in the database that use the `OS 2` operating system.*

### Task 3. List employees in specific departments

1. I filtered the rows returned from the `department` column in the `employees` table to include only employees from the `'Finance'` department because I needed to retrieve a list of all the employees in the `'Finance'` department to obtain their office numbers.
      * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance';`:

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96e24c8f-8aef-407c-9072-61d68a4fd491)

***Note:** The `employee_id` of the first row returned is 1003.*

2. I then modified the previous query so that it returns employees who are in the `'Sales'` department because I needed to retrieve a list of all the employees in the `'Sales'` department to obtain their office numbers.

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/288396c0-aa13-4cb8-8a1e-75bac3e333e1)

***Note:** There are 33 employees who work in the `Sales` department.*

### Task 4. Identify employee machines

1. My team had recently discovered that there were issues with machines in the South building. Given that, I wrote a query to identify which employee uses the office in `'South-109'`. The data was returned from the `office` column in the `employees` table.
      * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE office = 'South-109';`:


![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE office = 'South-109';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63860ba0-f558-498a-8a03-90d57a6bb150)

***Note:** The user ID of the employee with the computer issue is `jlansky`.*

2. I then modified the query I used in the step above, so that it returns information on all the employees in the `'South'` building. Use the `LIKE` operator with `%` in this query.
      * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE office LIKE 'South%';`:

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE office LIKE 'South%';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24fccbd7-f994-4f68-b610-b41e3ce7e00b)

***Note:** The `LIKE` keyword in SQL performs simple string matches. The matching pattern may include the wildcard `%` to represent a string of any length. This wildcard may be placed both before and after the targeted substring. The first employee on the list returned works in the `Finance` department.*


### Outcomes
As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in using SQL to:

* Apply the WHERE clause to filter query results.
* Use the LIKE operator to filter for patterns.

I am now well on my way to running SQL queries to retrieve specific data from a database.
