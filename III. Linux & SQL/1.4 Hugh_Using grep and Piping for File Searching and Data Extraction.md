# Task 1. Search for Error Messages in a Log File

1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/logs directory`.
    * The command to complete this step is cd logs:

![cd logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b86c3b3b-b57f-499b-836e-bef79dc1bab1)

2. I then used `grep` to filter the `server_logs.txt file`, and return all lines containing the text string error.
    * The command to complete this step is `grep error server_logs.txt`:

![grep error server_logs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a71973cb-5570-42c0-813e-ebf00f1d5dc3)

* This `grep` command will filter *server_logs.txt* file, and return a list of the lines that match the text string `error`.

***Note:** The first argument passed to grep is the string I am searching for, and the second argument is the name of the file I am searching through.*

Based on the output above I can infer the following:

* There are six entries in the `server_logs.txt` file that include the error string.

# Task 2. Find Files Containing Specific Strings
1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is cd /home/analyst/reports/users:

![cd /home/analyst/reports/users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3df60df-79c0-4ef1-8f0d-40bdb46e5f5a)

2. Using the pipe character (`|`), I piped the output of the `ls` command to the `grep` command to list only the files containing the string `Q1` in their names.
      * The command to complete this step is `ls | grep Q1`:

![ls | grep Q1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af34233f-6848-47da-a205-6131b4713486)

Based on the output above I can infer the following:

* There are three files in the `reports/users` directory that have `Q1` in their names.

***Note:** Piping sends the standard output of one command to the standard input of another command for further processing. In the example, the output of the `grep` command is piped to the `ls` command and the output displayed in the shell.*

3. In order to list the files that contain the word `access` in their names.
      * The command to complete this step `ls | grep access`:

![ls | grep access](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c5f8cdd-f666-4ad8-be2f-d3e5882c243e)

Based on the output above I can infer the following:

* There are four files in the `reports/users` directory that have the text string access in their names.

# Task 3. Search More File Contents

1. To display the files in the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory. 
      *  The command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45184fa0-b2f9-4c9c-abad-3df754a9b596)

2. I searched the `Q2_deleted_users.txt` file for the username `jhill`.
      * The command to complete this step is `grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt`:

![grep jhill Q2_deleted_users.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30316399-b3eb-4593-9b2c-79375e2c54e8)

Based on the output above I can infer the following:

* There the user `jhill` is listed in the `Q2_deleted_users.txt file`.

I the searched the `Q4_added_users.txt` file to list the users who were added to the Human Resources department.
The command to complete this step `grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt`:

![grep "Human Resources" Q4_added_users.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f410f9a-5aa1-47ab-af4e-0234c4392de9)

***Note:** In order for `grep` to interpret a string of two or more words correctly, you must enclose it in quotes (`"Human Resources"`).*

Based on the output above I can infer the following:

* Two new users were added to the `Human Resources` department in quarter 4.
