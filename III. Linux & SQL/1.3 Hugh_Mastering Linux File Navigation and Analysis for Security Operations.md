# Task 1. Get the Current Directory Information

To do this, I typed `pwd` to display your working directory.
* This will show that my current working directory is the home directory.

![pwd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05668ec4-36df-41f4-8059-c0d8b430a9fa)

To display the names of the files and directories in the current working directory, I typed `ls`.
* The output should be:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/867dd533-9b94-45ab-8603-765b44d2fbeb)

Based on the outputs above we can infer the following:
* The lab starts with `/home/analyst` as my current working directory.
* The lab starts with four subdirectories in the `/home/analystdirectory`, namely `logs`, `notes`, `temp`, and `reports`.
  
## Task 2. Change Directory and List the Subdirectories

1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/reports` directory.
* The command to complete this step using a relative path is `cd reports`

![cd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d55f873-51ad-4858-8746-311e5c7c3760)

***Note:** The `cd` command accepts absolute and relative paths. An absolute path includes all the directories from the root of the file system and starts with a `/`. An alternative is a relative path, which is expressed starting from the current directory and starts without the initial `/`. The above command uses a relative path.*

* The command to complete this step using an absolute path is `cd /home/analyst/reports`

![cd absolute path](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b2830a-5acc-4390-80b4-f1043f208ca9)

2. To display the files and subdirectories in the /home/analyst/reports directory the command to complete this step is `ls`
* The output should be:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a37c2b3-6375-4d48-9b79-493215499fa3)

Based on the outputs above we can infer the following:
* The subdirectory contained in the `/home/analyst/reports` directory is called `users`.

# Task 3. Locate and Read the Contents of a File

1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory, and the command to complete this step is `cd /home/analyst/reports/users`.
* The above command uses an absolute path. I could also use the relative path which is `cd users`.
  
![cd /home/analyst/reports/users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/926ae603-0ed6-4d80-9675-61c5d7ff30c4)

2. I listed the files in the current directory, and the command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a081c217-d15c-4c81-9a3e-e0e9ad350b53)

3. To display the contents of the `Q1_added_users.txt file` the command to complete this step is `cat Q1_added_users.txt`:

![cat Q1_added_users.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b81dec1-38f8-4ba8-9995-a2802dc3df96)

***Note:** The `cat` command prints the contents of a file to the shell. I can specify the file to display using absolute or relative paths.*
* The absolute path would be `cat /home/analyst/reports/users/Q1_added_users.txt`.

Based on the outputs above I can infer the following:
* The employee with `username` aezra works in the Human Resources department.
* The `employee_id` of the employee with  `username` mreed in the Information Technology department is 1104.

# Task 4. Navigate to a Directory and Locate a File

1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/logs directory`, and the command to complete this step is `cd /home/analyst/logs`.

![cd /home/analyst/logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8014c5ac-47f5-49b1-ac87-b497c54f3b64)

2. To display the name of the file it contains the command to complete this step is `ls`
* This command displayed the following output:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c86101f-16df-4939-b118-a62ae5abd032)

3. In order to display the first 10 lines of this file. The command I used to complete this step is `head server_logs.txt`

![head server_logs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d689ba6-d490-43ee-ba9a-b0267a84ef06)

Based on the outputs above we can infer the following:
* There are three warning messages in the first 10 lines of the server_logs.txt file.

## Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands. I can now:

* Navigate directory structures with the cd command.
* Display the current working directory with the pwd command.
* List the contents of a directory with the ls command.
* Display the contents of files with the cat and head commands.
* Navigating directories and reading file contents are fundamental skills that I will frequently use when working with the shell.
