# Filter with AND, OR, and NOT

### Task 1. Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts

* I used the `AND` operator to retrieve the failed login attempts that occurred after business hours. 
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;`:

![SELECT *FROM log_in_attemptsWHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b58798a1-3726-4e52-a27e-ae6f7787d8a9)

***Note:** Values of `TRUE` and `FALSE` are not placed in single quotes because they are not string data. They are Boolean data, which is another data type. There are 19 failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00.*

### Task 2. Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates

* I used the `OR` operator to retrieve the failed login attempts on the specified days.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';`.

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c273269-a070-46a6-8ef3-f6ab7ebd4ced)

***Note:** There are `75` login attempts in these two days.*

### Task 3. Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico

1. I ran an SQL query to retrieve login attempts that did not originate in Mexico.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';`.

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b66452-a279-4643-ab53-52dc48bd7a0b)

***Note:** There are `144` login attempts made outside of Mexico.*

## For tasks 4, 5 and 6 I had to retrieve the information from the `department` and `office` columns in the `employees` table.

### Task 4. Retrieve Employees in Marketing

1. I ran an SQL query to view the columns and values in the `employees` table.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees;`.

![SELECT * FROM employees;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26c90a4a-36b1-42d6-be8c-d0972c80cd51)

2. I then wrote an SQL query to retrieve information about employees in the `'Marketing'` department who are located in all offices in the East building (such as `'East-170'` or `'East-320'`).
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';`.

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a9bcc7d-dbfc-40d1-998c-59fb70c335a6)

***Note:** Note: I had to use the `AND` and `LIKE` operators to satisfy both of these criteria. The username of the first employee in the `Marketing` department in the East building is `elarson`.*

### Task 5. Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales

I wrote an SQL query to retrieve records for employees in the `'Finance'` or the `'Sales'` department, because my team needed to perform a different update to the computers of all employees in the `Finance` or the `Sales` department, and I needed to locate information on these employees.

      * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';`.

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0baf15aa-54fa-435c-aa56-2c8e3c55a136)

***Note:** Even though both conditions are based on the same column, you need to write out both full conditions. This means that you must specify `department` as the column in both conditions. The username of the first employee in the `Sales` department is `lrodriqu`.*

### Task 6. Retrieve All Employees not in IT

I wrote an SQL query to SQL query to retrieve records for employees who are not in the 'Information Technology' department, because my team needed to make one more update. This update was already made to employee computers in the Information Technology department. The team needs information about employees who are not in that department.

      * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';`.

![SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT department = 'Information Technology';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/741b9dd6-2902-4527-962f-2e8d1aad937d)

***Note:** There are `161` employees who arenâ€™t in the Information Technology department.*

###  Outcomes

As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in using SQL to:

* Run queries to retrieve information from a database.
* Use `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators to filter query results.
  
I am now well-prepared to run complex SQL queries to extract specific data from a database.
