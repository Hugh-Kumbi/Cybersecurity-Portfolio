Conclusion
Great work!

You have completed this activity and practiced applying

the `WHERE` keyword
the `BETWEEN` and `AND` operators, and
operators for working with numeric or date and time data types (for example, `=`, `>`, `>=`)
to filter data from a table.

Youâ€™re now ready to filter for numbers and dates to extract all sorts of useful data!
