Conclusion
Great work!

You now have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to

navigate directory structures with the cd command,
display the current working directory with the pwd command,
list the contents of a directory with the ls command, and
display the contents of files with the cat and head commands.
Navigating through directories and reading file contents are fundamental skills that youâ€™ll often use when communicating through the shell.
