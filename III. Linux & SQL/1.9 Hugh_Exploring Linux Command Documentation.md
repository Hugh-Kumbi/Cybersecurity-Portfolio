# Exploring Linux Command Documentation

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Learn More About Commands

1. I ran the `whatis` command to get a short description of `cat`.
    * The command to complete this step is `whatis cat`:

![whatis cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13006cdb-4520-43ac-8c42-22f4c017c7d1)

***Note:**  The first two words of the short description returned are “concatenate files”.*

2. In order to get more details about `cat` and all its options, I used the `man` command.
      * The command to complete this step is `man cat`.
      * The `man` command returns a general description of `cat` and information about each of its options:

![man cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f839a8b1-e16d-42f3-bd30-6d6ab5361411)

* When the first page of information returned by `man` is displayed, the output pauses.

***Note:** By pressing the **ENTER** key or output the next page of the manual by pressing the space bar I am able output more information one line at a time. In addition to that The -n,--number option numbers all the output lines.*

3. In order to exit the manual page I pressed **Q**:

![Press Q to exit this manual page.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/446ab4b8-c9c1-4de7-ba03-97e53f343eb2)

4. I then used `apropos` to find a command that returns the first part of a file.
      * The command to complete this step is `apropos -a first part file`:

![apropos -a first part file](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6471c114-0698-4298-a172-a0a50afc4c80)

***Note:** There is no right and wrong when using `apropos` in terms of keywords. It is a very focused search. It will only return commands that correspond to keywords supplied. In a situation where the first returned command does not provide what I need it's possible to keep trying. In addition, using the `-a` option will limit results to only those commands that match all keywords supplied. It's imperative to bear in mind that the `head` command returns only the first part of a file.*

### Task 2. Explore the Useradd Command

1. I used the most appropriate Linux command to get help on the `useradd` command and learn more about all of its options.
      * The command to complete this step is `man useradd`:

![man useradd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef91616c-b58f-4670-a0de-6caa072964dd)

***Note:** It's possible to output more information one line at a time by pressing the **ENTER** key or output the next page of the manual by pressing the space bar. It's imperative to bear in mind that the `-e` option can be used to set an expiration date for a temporary user account.*

2. In order to exit the manual page I pressed **Q**:

![Press Q to exit this manual page.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57258b5-70d8-474f-881a-f5f6e1355d4d)

### Task 3. Explore the Rm and Rmdir Commands

* I also used the most appropriate Linux command to quickly remind myself of the difference between the `rm` and `rmdir` commands.
  * The commands to complete this step are `whatis rm` and `whatis rmdir`given that this task requires entering two commands:

![whatis rm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5664b34-7266-453a-a93f-ae98ffbf92f3)

![whatis rmdir](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bd046d3-e168-41bc-bc4f-baff413064a2)

***Note:** The `rmdir` command removes only empty directories.*

### Task 4. Determine Which Command to Use

* I finally used the most appropriate Linux command with the keywords `create new group` as I needed to create a new group but I couldn’t remember what command to use.
   * The correct command to solve this step is `apropos -a create new group`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a9fc556-ccda-430a-93bf-8e4ebf658560)

***Note:** The `groupadd` can be used to create a new group.*

### Outcomes and Skills Gained

**As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:**

* Get a short description of a command.
* Display the man pages for a command.
* Find commands based on keywords about their function.

This ability will be invaluable as I navigate the Linux command line effectively.
