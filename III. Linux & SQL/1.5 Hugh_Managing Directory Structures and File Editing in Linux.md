# Managing Directory Structures and File Editing in Linux.md

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Create a New Directory

1. I created a new subdirectory called logs in the `/home/analyst director`.
    * The command to complete this step is `mkdir logs`:

![mkdir logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8b11d27-a68d-43a8-8783-88f773cd72f0)

2. I then listed the contents of the `/home/analyst` directory to confirm that I had successfully created the new logs subdirectory.
* The command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa2adaa1-fa39-4742-95d4-3918dbede16d)

***Note:** The output listed the original three directories and the new logs subdirectory.*

### Task 2. Remove a Directory

1. I removed the `/home/analyst/temp` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `rmdir temp`:
  
![rmdir temp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e28dfe57-ba10-440e-ad7d-debc2513697c)

I then listed the contents of the `/home/analyst` directory to confirm that I had removed the `temp` subdirectory. 
      
      * The command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d15c4f98-b611-4fa2-9272-6431be3f26c5)

### Task 3. Move a File

1. I navigated to the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `cd /home/analyst/notes`:

![cd /home/analyst/notes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dccbda99-455e-4fa7-9091-daf5932ad9d0)

***Note:** The previous command used the absolute path, I can use the relative path which is `cd notes`.*

2. Then I moved the `Q3patches.txt` file from the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to the `/home/analyst/reports` directory.
    * The command to complete this step `mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/`:

![mv Q3patches.txt /home/analyst/reports/](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7c9b5da-65bc-40d5-982d-dcd950d136d1)

3. After that I listed the contents of the `/home/analyst/reports` directory to confirm that I had moved the file successfully.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls /home/analyst/reports`:

![ls /home/analyst/reports](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6336c93c-baaf-4756-851b-d06a3c42ffd3)

***Note:** After listing the contents of the reports directory, it now shows that three quarterly report files are now in the reports directory*

### Task 4. Remove a File

1. I removed the `tempnotes.txt` file from the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `rm tempnotes.txt`:

![rm tempnotes.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4ded012-8f19-4989-a780-e653bb98a8ac)

2. Then I listed the contents of the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to confirm that I had removed the file successfully.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53dd6fe8-762c-4bf8-8f28-0ce4da44e301)

***Note:** Once that was done no files were listed in the notes directory*

### Task 5. Create a new File

1. I used the touch command to create an empty file called `tasks.txt` in the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.
The command to complete this step is `touch tasks.txt`:

![touch tasks.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306a0631-e832-4031-a4be-fb3f450126cf)

2. I then listed the contents of the `/home/analyst/notes` directory to confirm that I had created a new file.
The command to complete this step is `ls`:

![ls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b223f47-c0c1-4bec-8c08-6bcad29a1f9a)

***Note:** A file called `tasks.txt` now exists in the notes directory*

### Task 6. Edit a File

1. Using the nano text editor, I opened the `tasks.txt` file that is located in the `/home/analyst/notes` directory.
The command to complete this step is `nano tasks.txt`:

![nano tasks.txt result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fad537b-214f-437b-98ba-b75040e32926)

***Note:** This action changes the shell from the normal Bash interface to the nano text editor interface.*

2. I then typed the following text into the text input area of the nano editor:
  `Completed tasks`
  `1. Managed file structure in /home/analyst`

![  Completed tasks  1. Managed file structure in /home/analyst](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/976b39f3-b7a7-4322-b752-2175b50464f6)

3. I typed the keys `CTRL+` to exit the nano text editor and that triggers a prompt asking whether I would like to `Save modified bufferer`

![GNU prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28685557-0ff3-48e7-9bb1-aa7f10b0d31b)

4. Then I typed `Y` to confirm that I wanted to save the new data to the file.
      * After that I pressed `ENTER` to confirm that the **File Name to Write** is `tasks.txt`.

![Press ENTER to confirm that File Name to Write is tasks.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37e310fe-13e3-4583-ae54-818050daff88)

5. I then used the `clear` command to clear the Bash shell window and remove any traces of the nano text input area.
      * The command to complete this step is `clear`:

![clear](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e4a3704-f489-4f8c-9c2c-a4105f1e172c)

6. Finally I had to display the contents of the `tasks.txt` file to confirm that it contains the updated task details.
      * The command to complete this step is `cat tasks.txt`:

![cat tasks.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18ad82ae-61d3-45cc-9cc2-9006bb183fe8)

### Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:

Create and remove directories.
Copy, move, and remove files.
Edit files with the nano text editor.
I'm now well on my way to managing directories and files in a Linux environment!
