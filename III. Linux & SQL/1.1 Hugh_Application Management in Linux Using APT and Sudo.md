# Application Management in Linux Using APT and Sudo

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Ensure that APT is Installed

1. I confirmed that the APT package manager is installed in my Linux environment.
   * The command to complete this step is `apt`.
    * When installed, `apt` displays basic usage information when the command is run. This includes the version information and a description of the tool:

![APT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90f89bd-1607-4260-a451-02f58b3480f1)

As shown in the screenshot above, APT is already installed. Since the lab environment uses a Linux Bash shell on a Debian-based system, APT comes preinstalled by default. It is also the recommended package manager for Debian-based distributions.

### Task 2. Install and Uninstall the Suricata Application

1. I used the APT package manager to install the Suricata application.
    * The command to complete this step is `sudo apt install suricata`.

***Note:** The `apt install` and `apt remove` commands must be prefixed with the sudo command as elevated privileges are required to install and uninstall software in Linux.*

When installing an application with APT, the output displays details of all the software to be installed. This may include additional applications that depend on the new software. These additional applications are called the dependencies of the software to be installed. 
    * After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

2. I verified that Suricata is installed by running the newly installed application.
  * The command to complete this step is `suricata`.
   * When Suricata is installed, version and usage information is listed:

![Check Suricata version](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43b92183-10f3-4680-a429-6bc0ef18ce4c)

3. I used the APT package manager to uninstall Suricata.
  * The command to complete this step is `sudo apt remove suricata`.
   * After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

![Uninstall Suricata](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40cb108b-2d9f-49c7-b004-b86bb87c8553)

4. I verified that Suricata had been uninstalled by running the application command again..
  * The command to complete this step is `suricata`.
   * Given that I have uninstalled `suricata`, the output is an error message:

![Check Suricata's presence](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2b09ce-15df-47ec-91ae-7789ce8dab51)

### Task 3. Install the Tcpdump Application
* I used the APT package manager to install tcpdump..
 * The command to complete this step is `sudo apt install tcpdump`.

![sudo apt install tcpdump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a5fdab8-607c-4aac-9139-93943c71b683)

### Task 4. List the Installed Applications

1. I used the APT package manager to list all installed applications.
 * The command to complete this step is `apt list --installed`.
  * This produced a long list of applications because Linux has a lot of software installed by default:

![Installed Applications](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1a0700-a6fa-4741-a591-04fad8556e33)

2. After that I searched through the list to find the `tcpdump` application I had installed.
  * The `suricata` application is not listed because I installed and then uninstalled that application:

![Tcpdump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56233fbc-2e15-4da7-bcd7-c4ff40de9dd1)

### Task 5. Reinstall the Suricata Application
1. I ran a command to install the Suricata application.
 * The command to complete this step is `sudo apt install suricata`.
  * After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

![Suricata application](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/831f5cf1-7842-40b4-8fdb-13dbd2b44f0f)

2. I then used the APT package manager to list the installed applications.
 * The command to complete this step is `apt list --installed`.
  * After that I searched through the list to confirm that the `suricata` application has been installed.
   * The output included the following lines:

### Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience with the APT package manager. I can now:

* Install applications effectively.
* Uninstall applications when they are no longer needed.
* List installed applications to manage and audit system software.
  
These skills are essential for managing installed applications in Linux, a critical capability for any security analyst.
