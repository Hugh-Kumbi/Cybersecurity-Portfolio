# Application Management in Linux Using APT and Sudo

## Task 1. Ensure that APT is Installed

 To do this, I typed `apt` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.
 * When installed, apt displays basic usage information when the command is run. This includes the version information and a description of the tool:

![APT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c90f89bd-1607-4260-a451-02f58b3480f1)

As shown in the screenshot, APT is already installed. Since the lab environment uses a Linux Bash shell on a Debian-based system, APT comes preinstalled by default. It is also the recommended package manager for Debian-based distributions.

## Task 2. Install and Uninstall the Suricata Application

1. I typed `sudo apt install suricata` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.

***Note:** The `apt install` and `apt remove` commands must be prefixed with the sudo command as elevated privileges are required to install and uninstall software in Linux.*

* When installing an application with APT, the output displays details of all the software to be installed. This may include additional applications that depend on the new software. These additional applications are called the dependencies of the software to be installed.

* After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

2. I typed `suricata` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.

3. I typed `sudo apt remove suricata` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.

* After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

4. I typed `suricata` after the command-line prompt and press **ENTER**.

Given that I have uninstalled Suricata, the output is an error message:

## Task 3. Install the Tcpdump Application
1. I typed `sudo apt install tcpdump` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.

![sudo apt install tcpdump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a5fdab8-607c-4aac-9139-93943c71b683)

## Task 4. List the Installed Applications

1. I typed `apt list --installed` after the command-line prompt and press **ENTER**.
* This produced a long list of applications because Linux has a lot of software installed by default.

![Installed Applications](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f1a0700-a6fa-4741-a591-04fad8556e33)

2. After that I searched through the list to find the tcpdump application I had installed.
* The suricata application is not listed because I installed and then uninstalled that application

## Task 5. Reinstall the Suricata Application
1. I typed `sudo apt install suricata` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.
* After running the above command, I was prompted to continue, so I typed `Yes` and pressed the **ENTER** key to respond.

2. I typed `apt list --installed` after the command-line prompt and pressed **ENTER**.

3. After that I searched through the list to confirm that the Suricata application has been installed.
* The output should include the following lines:

## Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience with the APT package manager. I can now:

* Install applications effectively.
* Uninstall applications when they are no longer needed.
* List installed applications to manage and audit system software.
  
These skills are essential for managing installed applications in Linux, a critical capability for any security analyst.
