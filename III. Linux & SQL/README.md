# Computing Essentials: Mastering Linux and SQL for Data Handling

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to foundational computing skills, focusing on using the Linux command line and querying databases with SQL. It showcases proficiency in navigating the Linux operating system for efficient system management and performing SQL queries to manage and analyze data.

## Contents
1. **Application Management in Linux Using APT and Sudo**
- In this lab, I used the **Advanced Package Tool (APT)** and `sudo` commands to install and manage applications in a Debian-based Linux virtual machine, focusing on network security tools like Suricata and tcpdump. Suricata serves as an intrusion detection system, while tcpdump is a packet analyzer for examining network traffic. The use of a virtual machine ensured a safe testing environment with the ability to revert changes if needed. This activity highlighted the importance of mastering Linux application management, a crucial skill for configuring and utilizing security tools effectively as a security analyst.
  
2. **Exploring Linux Shell Interactions: Understanding Input, Output, and Basic Calculations**
- In this lab, I used the `echo` command to explore how input is received and output is returned in the Linux shell, followed by the `expr` command to perform basic calculations and further understand input and output interactions. This activity provided foundational knowledge of communicating with the Linux operating system through the shell, an essential skill for a security analyst to execute commands effectively and interpret system responses, including error messages.

3. **Mastering Linux File Navigation and Analysis for Security Operations**
- In this lab activity, I navigated the Linux file structure, located specific files, and read their contents using commands in the Linux shell. This exercise helped me develop essential skills for navigating, managing, and analyzing files remotely through a Linux shell, which is critical for my role as a security analyst.

4. **Using grep and Piping for File Searching and Data Extraction**
- In this lab, I used the grep command and piping to efficiently search through files and extract specific information. By working with various files, including server log files and user data files, I practiced retrieving targeted data. I completed these tasks using Linux commands in the Bash shell, enhancing my ability to analyze and process file contents as part of my skill set in Linux systems management.

5. **Managing Directory Structures and File Editing in Linux**
- In this lab, I used Linux commands to modify a directory structure and manage the files it contains. I also utilized the nano text editor to add text to a file. This activity reinforced the importance of organizing directories and files to streamline data management. As a security analyst, being able to create, remove, and edit directories and files is a crucial skill for detecting issues and maintaining data security effectively.

6. **Configuring Authorization and Managing Permissions in Linux**
- In this lab activity, I used Linux commands to configure authorization and manage access to system resources. I explored the concept of file and directory permissions, learning how to change ownership to control access to specific files and directories. By setting appropriate access permissions, I helped mitigate security risks by limiting unauthorized access to sensitive information. This task is a crucial skill for a security analyst, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify critical system files, thereby maintaining the overall security of the system. 

7. **Demonstrating File Permission Management in Linux**
- In this activity, I created a new portfolio document showcasing my experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions. This document highlights my ability to control access to files and directories, an essential skill for ensuring system security.

8. **Managing User Access in Linux**
- In this lab activity, I used the  `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`, and `chown` commands to manage user access in the Linux Bash shell. By utilizing these commands, I was able to add, modify, and delete user accounts, as well as change file ownership to control access. Since these tasks require root (superuser) privileges, I used sudo to execute the commands. Proper management of users and their access to resources is a critical skill for a security analyst, as it helps maintain control over who can access and modify system files and data.

9. **Exploring Linux Command Documentation**
- In this lab activity, I explored how to get help and find information directly through the Linux command line. I used the `man` and `whatis` commands to retrieve details about specific Linux commands and their functions. Additionally, I used the `apropos` command to search manual pages for commands that match a specified string. As a security analyst, it’s essential to know how to efficiently discover relevant commands and understand their usage, ensuring I can troubleshoot issues and find solutions quickly when working in a Linux environment.

10. **Querying Databases with SQL: SELECT, FROM, and ORDER BY**
- In this lab activity, I used SQL commands to retrieve and organize information from a database. I applied the `SELECT` and `FROM` statements to return specific data and used the `ORDER BY` keyword to sort the query results based on a designated column. As a security analyst, knowing how to query and analyze database information is essential for identifying patterns, improving security, and ensuring data integrity.




4. **Applying Filters to SQL Queries**
- In this activity, I reviewed a scenario involving a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address this breach, I focused on identifying common network hardening tools that could enhance the organization’s overall security. I then selected a specific vulnerability within the company’s network and proposed several network hardening methods to mitigate it. Finally, I explained how these methods and tools would be effective in managing the vulnerability, preventing future breaches, and strengthening the organization's defenses against potential cyberattacks.
  
5. **SQL Join** Review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
