# Computing Essentials: Mastering Linux and SQL for Data Handling

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to foundational computing skills, focusing on using the Linux command line and querying databases with SQL. It showcases proficiency in navigating the Linux operating system for efficient system management and performing SQL queries to manage and analyze data.

## Contents
1. **Application Management in Linux Using APT and Sudo**
- In this lab, I used the **Advanced Package Tool (APT)** and `sudo` commands to install and manage applications in a Debian-based Linux virtual machine, focusing on network security tools like Suricata and tcpdump. Suricata serves as an intrusion detection system, while tcpdump is a packet analyzer for examining network traffic. The use of a virtual machine ensured a safe testing environment with the ability to revert changes if needed. This activity highlighted the importance of mastering Linux application management, a crucial skill for configuring and utilizing security tools effectively as a security analyst.
  
2. **Examine Input and Output**
- In this project, I tackled a scenario where a customer of the company I work for experienced a security issue while accessing the company's website. I identified the likely cause of the service interruption, analyzed how the attack occurred, and detailed the negative impact it had on the website's functionality and user trust. This hands-on analysis allowed me to demonstrate my ability to investigate network security issues and communicate findings effectively.

3. **Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions**
- In this activity, I took on the role of a cybersecurity analyst for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. When visitors attempted to load the main webpage, they encountered a security issue. My task was to investigate the problem, identify the root cause, document the findings, and recommend a solution to resolve the security issue. This involved analyzing traffic, examining potential vulnerabilities, and proposing steps to safeguard the website against similar incidents in the future.

4. **Applying Filters to SQL Queries**
- In this activity, I reviewed a scenario involving a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address this breach, I focused on identifying common network hardening tools that could enhance the organization’s overall security. I then selected a specific vulnerability within the company’s network and proposed several network hardening methods to mitigate it. Finally, I explained how these methods and tools would be effective in managing the vulnerability, preventing future breaches, and strengthening the organization's defenses against potential cyberattacks.
  
5. **SQL Join** Review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
