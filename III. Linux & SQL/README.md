# Computing Essentials: Mastering Linux and SQL for Data Handling

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials related to foundational computing skills, focusing on using the Linux command line and querying databases with SQL. It showcases proficiency in navigating the Linux operating system for efficient system management and performing SQL queries to manage and analyze data.

## Contents
1. **Install Software in a Linux Distribution**
- In this activity, I analyzed DNS and ICMP traffic in transit using data captured from a network protocol analyzer tool. Through careful examination, I identified the specific network protocol utilized in the assessment of a cybersecurity incident. This process allowed me to gain insights into the nature of the incident and the role of these protocols in the broader context of network security.
  
2. **Examine Input and Output**
- In this project, I tackled a scenario where a customer of the company I work for experienced a security issue while accessing the company's website. I identified the likely cause of the service interruption, analyzed how the attack occurred, and detailed the negative impact it had on the website's functionality and user trust. This hands-on analysis allowed me to demonstrate my ability to investigate network security issues and communicate findings effectively.

3. **Managing File Permissions**
- In this activity, I took on the role of a cybersecurity analyst for a company that hosts the cooking website, yummyrecipesforme.com. When visitors attempted to load the main webpage, they encountered a security issue. My task was to investigate the problem, identify the root cause, document the findings, and recommend a solution to resolve the security issue. This involved analyzing traffic, examining potential vulnerabilities, and proposing steps to safeguard the website against similar incidents in the future.

4. **Applying Filters to SQL Queries**
- In this activity, I reviewed a scenario involving a social media organization that recently experienced a significant data breach caused by undetected vulnerabilities. To address this breach, I focused on identifying common network hardening tools that could enhance the organization’s overall security. I then selected a specific vulnerability within the company’s network and proposed several network hardening methods to mitigate it. Finally, I explained how these methods and tools would be effective in managing the vulnerability, preventing future breaches, and strengthening the organization's defenses against potential cyberattacks.
  
5. **SQL Join** Review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
