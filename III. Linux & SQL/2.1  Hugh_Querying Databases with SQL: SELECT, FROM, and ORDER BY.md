# Querying Databases with SQL: SELECT, FROM, and ORDER BY

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Retrieve Employee Device Data

1. I ran a query to select all device information from the `machines` table because I needed to retrieve all the information about the employee devices.
    * The command to complete this step is`SELECT *
FROM machines;`.
   * The output returns all the contents of the `machines` table:

![SELECT *FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c6a044-6597-407f-bb97-be9c872fcf15)

***Note:** Using the asterisk (`*`) returns all data from the specified table. Also, table names in MySQL are case-sensitive.*

2. I ran a query to select only the `device_id` and `email_client` columns from the `machines` table because I had to focus on the email client running on various devices. 
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT device_id, email_client
FROM machines;`:
      * The output should return only the selected columns of the `machines` table:

![SELECT device_id, email_client FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/655f3aee-abce-4da6-a6cc-2b0eaf5619ee)

***Note:** The email client returned in the third row is Email Client 2.*

3. Finally, I completed the query to return only the `device_id`, `operating_system`, and `OS_patch_date` columns from the `machines` table becasuse I needed information on the operating systems used on various devices and their last patch date.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date
FROM machines;`:

![SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb3e057-2f27-4a1c-aa6b-ff8348fb703c)

***Note:** The patch date of the first entry is 2021-09-01.*

### Task 2. Investigate Login Activity

1. I wrote an SQL query to select the `event_id` and `country` columns from the `log_in_attempts` table because I needed to investigate the locations where login attempts were made to ensure that theyâ€™re in expected areas **(the United States, Canada, or Mexico)**.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT event_id, country
FROM log_in_attempts;`:

![SELECT event_id, country FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa836e99-0f07-4fcd-8ab4-715a4a2bec90)

***Note:** Login attempts were not made from Australia.*

2. I wrote an SQL query that selects the `username`, `login_date`, and `login_time` columns from the `log_in_attempts` table.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT username, login_date, login_time
FROM log_in_attempts;`:

![SELECT username, login_date, login_time FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9741b178-297f-4e3e-826b-2c157a8bedd7)

***Note:** The username returned in the fifth row is jrafael.*

3. I then wrote an SQL query that selects all columns from the `log_in_attempts` table, using a single symbol after the `SELECT` keyword because I needed to get a complete picture of all login attempts.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts;`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e0e1314-24fa-41f0-a9d0-c69c4586444d)

### Task 3. Order Login Attempts Data

1. I ran a query, which orders `log_in_attempts` data by `login_date` because I needed to sort the information by date.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date;`:

![SELECT *FROM log_in_attempts ORDER BY login_date;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c340b2e-7611-4fdc-9264-36dc1662a232)

***Note:** The first record returned contains a username of ivelasco and a login date of 2022-05-08.*

2. I then modified the query from the previous step by adding the login time to the `ORDER BY` clause because I needed to further organize the previous results by ordering them by `login_time`. 
    * TThe command to complete this step is `SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts ORDER BY login_date, login_time;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6769d740-ea7d-4ed5-bb09-a8e745fce02e)

***Note:** The first record returned contains a username of `bsand` and a login time of `00:19:11`.*

### Outcomes

As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in running basic SQL queries to:

* Select specific columns from a table.
* Select all columns from a table using an asterisk (`*`).
* Sort query results using the `ORDER BY` keyword.
These basic queries provide a solid foundation for running more advanced queries and applying filters in the future.
