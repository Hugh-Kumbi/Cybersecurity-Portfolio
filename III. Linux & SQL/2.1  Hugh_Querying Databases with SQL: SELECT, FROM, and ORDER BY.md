# Task 1. Retrieve employee device data

1. I ran the following query to select all device information from the `machines` table:

`SELECT *
FROM machines;`

![SELECT *FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09c6a044-6597-407f-bb97-be9c872fcf15)

![SELECT device_id, email_client FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/655f3aee-abce-4da6-a6cc-2b0eaf5619ee)

![SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date FROM machines;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbb3e057-2f27-4a1c-aa6b-ff8348fb703c)


# Task 2. Investigate login activity

![SELECT event_id, country FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa836e99-0f07-4fcd-8ab4-715a4a2bec90)

![SELECT username, login_date, login_time FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9741b178-297f-4e3e-826b-2c157a8bedd7)

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e0e1314-24fa-41f0-a9d0-c69c4586444d)

# Task 3. Order login attempts data

![SELECT *FROM log_in_attempts ORDER BY login_date;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c340b2e-7611-4fdc-9264-36dc1662a232)

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts ORDER BY login_date, login_time;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6769d740-ea7d-4ed5-bb09-a8e745fce02e)

Conclusion
Great work!

You have completed this activity, and you now have practical experience in running basic SQL queries to

select specific columns from a table,
select all columns from a table by using an asterisk (*), and
sort query results using the ORDER BY keyword.
These basic queries form the foundation for running more advanced queries and applying filters later.
