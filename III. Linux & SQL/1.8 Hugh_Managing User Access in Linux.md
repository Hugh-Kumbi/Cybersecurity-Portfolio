# Managing User Access in Linux

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Add a new user

1. I wrote a command to add a user called `researcher9` to the system.
    * The command to complete this step is `sudo useradd researcher9`:

![sudo useradd researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5943a49-fdbc-4165-a318-8b9866f7db49)

2. Next, I had to add the new user to the `research_team group`. In order to do that I used the `usermod` command and `-g` option to add `researcher9` to the `research_team` group as their primary group.
    * The command to complete this step is `sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9`:

![sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02bfc339-83c4-4eda-a4d4-6e2d05b839af)

***Note:** Alternatively I could use the following variation of useradd when creating the user to perform both the above steps at once*:
    * `sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team`

### Task 2. Assign file ownership

![sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7fb3829-c985-4c1f-9280-abbc8a366382)

### Task 3. Add the user to a secondary group

![sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9da524-f73c-4edf-bb45-998caea0046b)

### Task 4. Delete a user

![sudo userdel researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0e3eaa-b829-47ed-8b82-9196733344e9)

![sudo groupdel researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0476158f-a2e2-4fc1-a5af-89503141bd71)

### Outcomes

As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:

* Add a new user.
* Add a user to a group.
* Change user permissions on files.
* Delete a user.
  
This is an important milestone in my journey toward managing users in Linux!
