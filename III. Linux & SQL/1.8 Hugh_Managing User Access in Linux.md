# Managing User Access in Linux

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Add a New User

1. I wrote a command to add a user called `researcher9` to the system.
    * The command to complete this step is `sudo useradd researcher9`:

![sudo useradd researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5943a49-fdbc-4165-a318-8b9866f7db49)

2. Next, I had to add the new user to the `research_team group`. In order to do that I used the `usermod` command and `-g` option to add `researcher9` to the `research_team` group as their primary group.
    * The command to complete this step is `sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9`:

![sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02bfc339-83c4-4eda-a4d4-6e2d05b839af)

**Note:** Alternatively I could use the following variation of useradd when creating the user to perform both the above steps at once:
   * `sudo useradd researcher9 -g research_team`.

### Task 2. Assign File Ownership

* I used the `chown` command to make `researcher9` the owner of `/home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt`.
   * The command to complete this step is `sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt`:

![sudo chown researcher9 /home/researcher2/projects/project_r.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7fb3829-c985-4c1f-9280-abbc8a366382)

### Task 3. Add the User to a Secondary Group

* I used the `usermod` command with the `-a` and `-G` options to add `researcher9` to the `sales_team` group as a secondary group.
   * The command to complete this step is `sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9`:
  
![sudo usermod -a -G sales_team researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9da524-f73c-4edf-bb45-998caea0046b)

***Note:** Options for Linux commands are case-sensitive, so I made sure to use a lowercase `-a` and an uppercase `-G`.*

### Task 4. Delete a User

1. I ran a command to delete `researcher9` from the system.
   * The command to complete this step is `sudo userdel researcher9`.
   * The command used above will output the following message:

![sudo userdel researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0e3eaa-b829-47ed-8b82-9196733344e9)

***Note:** When creatIng a new user in Linux, a group with the same name as the user is automatically created and the user is the only member of that group. After removing users, it is good practice to clean up any such empty groups that may remain behind.*

2. After that I ran the following command to delete the `researcher9` group that is no longer required:
   * `sudo groupdel researcher9`.

![sudo groupdel researcher9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0476158f-a2e2-4fc1-a5af-89503141bd71)

### Outcomes

As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:

* Add a new user.
* Add a user to a group.
* Change user permissions on files.
* Delete a user.
  
This is an important milestone in my journey toward managing users in Linux!
