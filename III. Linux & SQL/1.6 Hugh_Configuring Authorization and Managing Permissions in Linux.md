# Task 1. Check file and directory details

1. I navigated to the `projects` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `cd projects`:

![cd projects](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57ec2666-3d05-4042-93ab-f70761f213d0)

2. I then listed the contents and permissions of the `projects` directory.
    * The command to complete this step `ls -l`:

![ls -l](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76fb659c-0a20-41d5-92ce-d4d10411b847)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The research_team owns the files in the projects directory.

***Note:** The permissions of the files in the projects directory are as shown above. The date and time information returned is the same as the date and time when I ran the command.*

3. Finally, I checked whether any hidden files exist in the `projects` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls -la`:

![ls -la](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3c93713-403d-4c0f-b115-0bd9ad68a26f)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The .project_x.txt file is hidden.

# Task 2. Change File Permissions

1. First I checked whether any files in the `projects` directory had write permissions for the owner type of other.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls -l`:

![ls -l](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c668fd0a-757e-439f-bd6e-ac01261562a2)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The `project_k.txt` file has write permissions for other users.

2. Secondly, I changed the permissions of the file identified in the previous step so that the owner type of other doesn’t have write permissions.  
    * The command to complete this step is `chmod o-w project_k.txt`:

![chmod o-w project_k.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5434d37-0934-4823-994a-8f6600062695)

***Note:** Permissions are granted for three different types of owners, namely user, group, and other. In the `chmod` command, `u` sets the permissions for the user who owns the file, `g` sets the permissions for the group that owns the file, and `o` sets the permissions for others.*

3. The file `project_m.tx`t is a restricted file and should not be readable or writable by the group or other; only the user should have these permissions on this file. List the contents and permissions of the current directory and check if the group has read or write permissions.
The command to complete this step is `ls -l`:

![ls -l](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe464a65-7940-467f-ae8d-25ffb3ce6eb4)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The group permissions of the `project_m.txt` file is read only.

4. Use the `chmod` command to change permissions of the `project_m.txt` file so that the group doesn’t have read or write permissions.
    * The command to complete this step:

![chmod g-r project_m.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0b7c12-5175-4190-bb5f-0c1cfeb5f4f3)

# Task 3. Change File Permissions on a Hidden File

1. I checked the permissions of the hidden file `.project_x.txt`.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls -la`:

![ls -la](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbab39af-dd8b-43ff-a303-b9bd4ea900a6)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The user and group owner types have incorrect write permissions.

2. I then changed the permissions of the file `.project_x.txt` so that both the user and the group can read, but not write to, the file.
    * The command to complete this step is `chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt`:

![chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6a28683-a967-4774-bbd0-30d6db5fd33c)

# Task 4. Change Directory Permissions

1. I then checked the permissions of the `drafts` directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `ls -l`:

![ls -l ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54e0259-b9cd-4cc2-adc8-fc7ce1c151ad)

Based on the above I can infer that:
    * The group has execute permissions and therefore has access to the drafts directory.

2. Finally I removed the execute permission for the group from the drafts directory.
    * The command to complete this step is `chmod g-x drafts`:

![chmod g-x drafts](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203717e0-15ef-4866-b201-14efccbd7507)

### Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:

* Examine file and directory permissions.
* Change permissions on files.
* Change permissions on directories.

This is an important milestone in my journey toward managing authorization in Linux!
