# Task 1. Retrieve Login Attempts After a Certain Date

1. I completed the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made after `'2022-05-09'`.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * FROM 
log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date > '2022-05-09';`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date > '2022-05-09';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c5b570c-5a15-4b6e-90be-1f73e6a43551)

***Note:** The number of login attempts made after the `2022-05-09` is `125`.*

2. I then completed the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts that were made on or after `'2022-05-09'` because I needed to expand the date range to include `2022-05-09` in my search.
* The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date >= '2022-05-09';`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date >= '2022-05-09';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fad2b54-09dd-4def-84a3-7769ab35bf9c)

***Note:** The number of login attempts made from `2022-05-09` onward is `165`.*

# Task 2. Retrieve Logins in a Date Range

* I ran the query to retrieve the required records.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_date BETWEEN '2022-05-09' AND '2022-05-11';`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date BETWEEN '2022-05-09' AND '2022-05-11';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a76d2cbd-c6c0-4c09-8e00-abb8727c15ff)

***Note:** `123` login attempts were made between `2022-05-09` and `2022-05-11`.*

# Task 3. Investigate Logins at Certain Times

1. I wrote an SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made before `'07:00:00'`.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time < '07:00:00';`:

***Note:** Place time data in single quotation marks. The `username` in the fifth record returned from this query is `eraab`. This query returned more results than required.*

2. Given that the above query returned more results than required, I then modified the query to return logins between `'06:00:00'` and `'07:00:00'`.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE login_time BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '07:00:00';`:

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time < '07:00:00';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ede4c36-9624-4314-b9cc-8a9b1752264b)

***Note:** The earliest login attempt was at `06:01:31`.*

![SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time BETWEEN '06:00:00' AND '07:00:00';](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a602d639-2eb3-4d05-a41d-505754a6eb90)

# Task 4. Investigate Logins by Event ID

1. I wrote a query to return login attempts with `event_id` greater than or equal to `100`.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT event_id, username, login_date 
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE event_id >= 100;`:

![SELECT event_id, username, login_date FROM log_in_attempts WHERE event_id >= 100;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023a4c4b-cef0-4a31-87f4-243a7c67191e)

***Note:** The `event_id` column contains numeric data; do not place numeric data in quotation marks. The login date of the third result returned is `2022-05-09.`This query returned more results than required.*

2. Given that the above query returned more results than required, I then modified the query to return only login attempts with `event_id` between `100` and `150`.
    * The command to complete this step is `SELECT event_id, username, login_date
FROM log_in_attempts 
WHERE event_id BETWEEN 100 AND 150;`:

![SELECT event_id, username, login_date FROM log_in_attempts WHERE event_id BETWEEN 100 AND 150;](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5fb5e92-2a8b-4875-9c43-fadc8a98b79a)

***Note:** The username of the seventh result is `tmitchel.`.*

### Outcomes
As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in using SQL to:

* Apply the `WHERE` keyword to filter data.
* Use the `BETWEEN` and `AND` operators for range-based filtering.
* Work with operators like `=`, `>`, and `>=` to filter numeric and date/time data types.

I am now ready to filter for numbers and dates to extract a wide variety of useful data!
