# Task 1. Generate Output with the `echo` Command

1. To do this, I typed `echo hello` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
* The `hello` string was returned:

![echo hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a0caa9-a20a-4159-befc-22fa79f68e2a)

The command `echo hello` is the input to the shell, and `hello` is the output from the shell.

2. I reran the command, but included quotation marks around the string data. Type `echo "hello"` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
* The `hello` string was returned again:

![echo "hello"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c12da962-53f9-4436-b787-81215a84e222)

***Note:** The output is the same as before. The quotation marks are **optional** in this case, but they tell the shell to group a series of characters together. This can be useful when I need to pass a string that contains certain characters that might be otherwise misinterpreted by the command.*

3. I typed `echo "Hugh" into the shell, and pressed **ENTER**.
![echo "Hugh"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2145c4b5-0363-4891-b823-246e5693442e)

* The name I entered as the string was returned as the output.

# Task 2. Generate Output with the `expr` Command

I typed `expr 32 - 8` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
* The following result was returned:

![expr 32 - 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd0e1a4-0358-41df-a53f-7e7acd6fe2a7)

***Note:** The `expr` command requires that all terms and operators in an expression are separated by spaces. For example: `expr 32 - 8`, and not `expr 32-8`.*

I typed `expr 3500 * 12` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
* The following result was returned:

![expr 3500 * 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bd89c5-082a-47f4-9733-da37f57b2b77)

## Task 3. Clear the Bash Shell
I typed `clear` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
![clear](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6543a8b1-82ff-4666-a575-4fd1095ce2a7)

***Note:** All previous commands and output will be cleared, and the user prompt and cursor will return to the upper left of the shell window.*

## Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands. I can now:

* Generate output with the `echo` command.
* Generate output with the `expr` command.
* Clear the Bash shell using the `clear` command.

Understanding input and output is crucial when working with the shell. I'm now more comfortable with these basic concepts, which will be essential as I move on to work with more advanced commands.
