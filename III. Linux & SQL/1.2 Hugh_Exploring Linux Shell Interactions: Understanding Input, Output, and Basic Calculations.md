# Exploring Linux Shell Interactions: Understanding Input, Output, and Basic Calculations

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1. Generate Output with the `echo` Command

1. To do this, I typed `echo hello` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
    * The `hello` string was returned:

![echo hello](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a0caa9-a20a-4159-befc-22fa79f68e2a)

***Note:** The command `echo hello` is the input to the shell, and `hello` is the output from the shell.*

2. I reran the command, but included quotation marks around the string data. I typed `echo "hello"` into the shell and pressed **ENTER**.
    * The `hello` string was returned again:

![echo "hello"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c12da962-53f9-4436-b787-81215a84e222)

***Note:** The output is the same as before. The quotation marks are **optional** in this case, but they tell the shell to group a series of characters together. This can be useful when I need to pass a string that contains certain characters that might be otherwise misinterpreted by the command.*

3. I typed `echo "Hugh"` into the shell, and pressed **ENTER**.
    * The name I entered as the string was returned as the output.

![echo "Hugh"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2145c4b5-0363-4891-b823-246e5693442e)

### Task 2. Generate Output with the `expr` Command

* I calculated the number of false positives using the `expr` command.
    * The command to complete this step is `expr 32 - 8`.
    * The following result was returned:

![expr 32 - 8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd0e1a4-0358-41df-a53f-7e7acd6fe2a7)

***Note:** The `expr` command requires that all terms and operators in an expression are separated by spaces. For example: `expr 32 - 8`, and **not** `expr 32-8`.*

* I then calculated the total number of logins expected in a year by multiplying 3500 by 12. From the information I have, I know that an average of 3500 login attempts have been made each month so far this year.
    * The command to complete this step is `expr 3500 * 12`.
    * The following result was returned:

![expr 3500 * 12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37bd89c5-082a-47f4-9733-da37f57b2b77)

### Task 3. Clear the Bash Shell

* When working in a shell environment, the screen can fill with previous input and output data. Clearing the screen allows me to create a clutter-free text environment to allow me to focus on what is important at that point in time.
      * The command to complete this step is `clear`.
      * The following result was returned:

![clear](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6543a8b1-82ff-4666-a575-4fd1095ce2a7)

***Note:** All previous commands and output will be cleared, and the user prompt and cursor will return to the upper left of the shell window.*

### Outcomes
As a result of completing this lab exercise, I have gained practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands. I can now:

* Generate output with the `echo` command.
* Generate output with the `expr` command.
* Clear the Bash shell using the `clear` command.

Understanding input and output is crucial when working with the shell. I'm now more comfortable with these basic concepts, which will be essential as I move on to work with more advanced commands.
