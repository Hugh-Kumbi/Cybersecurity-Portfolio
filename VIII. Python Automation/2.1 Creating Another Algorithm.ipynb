Additionally, I received a variable named `remove_list` that contained the IP addresses that needed to be removed from the list of allowed addresses.\n\nTo begin, I displayed both variables to explore their contents and ensure I understood the data before proceeding with the removal process.

I passed a list of IP addresses `[\"192.168.25.60\", \"192.168.140.81\", \"192.168.203.198\"]` as the second argument, which contained the IP addresses that needed to be removed from the file.\n\nAfter running the function, I used a `with` statement to open and read the updated contents of the allow list. I displayed the contents to verify that the IP addresses were successfully removed and that the file had been updated accordingly.",
