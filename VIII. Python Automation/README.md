# Python for Cybersecurity: Streamlining Detection and Response

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials focused on detection and incident response in cybersecurity. It highlights the use of Python to automate key cybersecurity tasks, enabling efficient detection, analysis, and response to incidents while aligning with the incident response lifecycle.

1.1  **Using Variables in Python for Security Analysis** 
- In this lab, I practiced using Python variables to manage security-related tasks, such as tracking allowed users, login attempts, and account statuses. I assigned values to variables, identified their data types (e.g., strings, integers, lists, booleans), and updated variables dynamically based on security events. For example, I incremented login attempts, validated user access, and locked accounts after exceeding login limits. These activities helped me understand how to efficiently automate security workflows and respond to incidents using Python's versatility in handling security information.
