# Python for Cybersecurity: Streamlining Detection and Response

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials focused on detection and incident response in cybersecurity. It highlights the use of Python to automate key cybersecurity tasks, enabling efficient detection, analysis, and response to incidents while aligning with the incident response lifecycle.

## Contents
1.1  **Using Variables in Python for Security Analysis** 
- In this lab, I practiced using Python variables to manage security-related tasks, such as tracking allowed users, login attempts, and account statuses. I assigned values to variables, identified their data types (e.g., strings, integers, lists, booleans), and updated variables dynamically based on security events. For example, I incremented login attempts, validated user access, and locked accounts after exceeding login limits. These activities helped me understand how to efficiently automate security workflows and respond to incidents using Python's versatility in handling security information.

1.2  **Creating a Conditional Statement** 
- In this lab, I practiced writing conditional statements in Python to automate security tasks. I used conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` to check conditions, such as verifying if a user has the correct permissions to access a device. By using these statements, I was able to ensure that certain actions only executed when specific criteria were met, enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. This hands-on experience reinforced my understanding of how conditional logic can be applied in security automation.

1.3  **Creating Loops** 
- In this lab, I practiced writing iterative statements in Python to automate repetitive security tasks. Using loops like `for` and `while`, I created scripts to efficiently process multiple IP addresses attempting to connect to a network. These iterations allowed me to analyze and log suspicious activity systematically, saving time and ensuring thorough coverage. This exercise helped me understand how iterative logic can streamline tasks that involve repetition, making security operations more effective and efficient.

1.4  **Defining and Calling a Function** 
- In this lab, I practiced defining and calling functions in Python to automate repetitive security tasks. I created custom functions to encapsulate specific processes and reused them as needed, improving the efficiency and readability of my code. Additionally, I explored Python's built-in functions to handle common operations. This experience reinforced the importance of modular programming and highlighted how functions can streamline security workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling reusable solutions.

1.5  **Creating More Functions** 
- In this lab, I worked with Python's built-in functions and created user-defined functions to analyze login attempts. Using built-in functions, I efficiently processed a list of failed login attempts per month to prepare the data for further analysis. Additionally, I defined a custom function to compare a user's login attempts for the current day against their average login attempts. This practice helped me understand how to leverage Python's capabilities to identify potential anomalies and improve efficiency in analyzing login patterns.

1.6  **Working with Strings in Python** 
- In this lab, I practiced creating and manipulating Python strings relevant to a security analyst's tasks. I worked with an employee ID, a device ID, and a URL, using Python code to process and analyze these string data types. This activity helped me become more familiar with handling string data, a critical skill for managing employee and device IDs, as well as analyzing network activity stored as strings.

1.7  **Developing an Algorithm** 
- In this lab, I developed a Python algorithm to automate the process of checking system access and device assignments. The algorithm first verified if a user was approved to access the system, then confirmed whether the device they presented matched the one assigned to them. This exercise helped me understand how to design step-by-step solutions for common security analyst tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in managing access controls.

1.8  **Using Regular Expressions to Find Patterns** 
- In this lab, I practiced using Python regular expressions to extract important information from strings and files, focusing on areas critical to cybersecurity. I wrote regex patterns to identify device IDs and flag IP addresses associated with unusual login attempts. Additionally, I used regex to detect devices requiring software updates, automating the process of locating potential vulnerabilities. This activity enhanced my ability to efficiently process and analyze log files, a vital skill for security analysts.

1.9  **Importing and Parsing a Text File** 
- In this lab, I practiced using Python functions and syntax to import and parse text files, focusing on analyzing security logs. I learned how to efficiently extract information from these files, which is a critical task for security analysts. By applying these skills, I enhanced my ability to handle and interpret security log data stored in text formats.

2.1  **Creating Another Algorithm** 
- In this lab, I developed a Python algorithm to manage a text file containing IP addresses with access to restricted content. I practiced parsing the file to read its contents and implemented functionality to update the file by removing IP addresses that no longer have access. This exercise enhanced my ability to automate file management processes and maintain access control efficiently, which is crucial in cybersecurity.

2.2  **Updating a File Through a Python Algorithm** 
- In this activity, I created a portfolio document showcasing my experience using Python to develop algorithms for opening and parsing files. I demonstrated my ability to manage file operations, including reading and updating file contents, which is essential for tasks such as analyzing security logs and maintaining access control. This document highlights my proficiency in Python and its application in automating cybersecurity processes.

2.2  **Debugging Python Code** 
- In this activity, I honed my debugging skills in Python by identifying and resolving errors in code to ensure automated processes ran smoothly. I worked through a series of tasks to pinpoint issues, correct them, and verify that the code achieved the desired outcomes. This practice strengthened my ability to troubleshoot and optimize Python scripts, an essential skill for automating and maintaining cybersecurity operations effectively.
