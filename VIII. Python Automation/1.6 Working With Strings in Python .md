# Working With Strings in Python

## Proposed Resolution

## Task 1

I converted the `employee_id` variable from a four-digit numeric format to a string format, storing the result in the same variable.

```python
# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value

employee_id = 4186

# Display the data type of `employee_id`

print(type(employee_id))

# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string

employee_id = str(employee_id)

# Display the data type of `employee_id` now

print(type(employee_id))

```

    <class 'int'>
    <class 'str'>

#### **Question 1**
**What do you observe about the data type of `employee_id` the first time it's displayed? What do you observe about the data type of `employee_id` the second time it's displayed (after the variable is reassigned)?**

The first time it is displayed, the data type of `employee_id` is integer. The second time it is displayed (after the variable is reassigned), the data type of `employee_id` is string.

## Task 2

I wrote a conditional statement that checks if the length of the employee ID is less than five digits. If it is, the code displays a message indicating that the employee ID doesn't meet the new five-digit standard. 

```python
# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value

employee_id = 4186

# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string

employee_id = str(employee_id)

# Conditional statement that displays a message if the employee ID length is less than 5 digits

if len(employee_id) < 5:
    print("This employee ID has less than five digits. It does not meet length requirements.")
    
```

    This employee ID has less than five digits. It does not meet length requirements.

## Task 3

I wrote an `if` statement that checks if the length of the `employee_id` is less than five digits. If the condition is `True`, I used string concatenation to add `"E"` in front of the existing four-digit `employee_id` to make it a five-character employee ID. After updating the employee ID, I displayed it again.

```python
# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value

employee_id = 4186

# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string

employee_id = str(employee_id)

# Display the `employee_id` as it currently stands

print(employee_id)

# Conditional statement that updates the `employee_id` if its length is less than 5 digits

if len(employee_id) < 5:
    employee_id = "E" + employee_id

# Display the `employee_id` after the update

print(employee_id)

```

    4186
    E4186

## Task 4

I extracted the fourth character from the `device_id` string using indexing. In Python, strings are zero-indexed, meaning that the first character is at position 0. To get the fourth character, I used the index `3`.

```python
# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters

device_id = "r262c36"

# Extract the fourth character in `device_id` and display it

print(device_id[3])

```

    2

## Task 5

I extracted the first through the third characters from the `device_id` string using slicing. In Python, I used the slice notation `device_id[:3]`, which takes characters from index `0` up to (but not including) index `3`.

```python
# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters

device_id = "r262c36"

# Extract the first through the third characters in `device_id` and display the result

device_id[0:3]

```




    'r26'

## Task 6
I extracted the protocol and the `://` characters from the URL by using string slicing. Given that the protocol is always `https` followed by `://`, I used the slice notation to capture these first parts of the URL. 

```python
# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Extract the protocol of `url` along with the syntax following it, display the result

print(url[0:8])

```

    https://

## Task 7

I used the `.index()` method to find the index where the domain extension `.com` starts in the given URL. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring.

```python
# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Display the index where the domain extension ".com" is located in `url`

print(url.index(".com"))

```

    19

## Task 8

I stored the index of the domain extension `.com` from the URL in a variable called `ind`, using the `.index()` method. This will help me track the position where the domain extension starts in the URL.

```python
# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of ".com" in `url`

ind = url.index(".com")

```

## Task 9

I used string slicing to extract the domain extension from the URL. The result was `".com"`, as expected.

```python
# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of ".com" in `url`

ind = url.index(".com")

# Extract the domain extension in `url` and display it

print(url[ind:ind+4])

```

    .com

#### **Question 2**
**What does this code output and why?**

This code outputs the domain name `.com` by first saving the starting position of the domain name in the `ind` variable and then extracting 4 consecutive characters from `url` starting from the saved position.

## Task 10

I used string slicing to extract the website name from the URL. The starting index was 8 (the position where the website name begins), and the ending index was the `ind` value, which marked the start of the domain extension. The result was the website name `"exampleURL1"`.    

```python
# Assign `url` to a specific URL

url = "https://exampleURL1.com"

# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of ".com" in `url`

ind = url.index(".com")

# Extract the website name in `url` and display it

print(url[8:ind])

```

    exampleURL1

## Conclusion
**What are your key takeaways from this lab?**
* Strings are instrumental in storing important, security-related data, such as device IDs and URLs.
* String concatenation allows you to easily combine information in a string with the information stored in another string.
* String slicing is a powerful technique that enables you to extract any subsection of a string.
* Python has many functions and methods that help analysts work with string values, as well as data that they want to convert to string format.
  * The `type()` function returns the data type of its input.
  * The `str()` function converts the input object into a string. For example, when called on an integer, `str()` returns that integer value converted to a string.
  * The `len()` function returns the number of elements in an object. When called on a string, `len()` returns the number of characters in that string.
  * The `.index()` method finds the first occurrence of the input in a string and returns its location. It provides the index where the substring begins.
