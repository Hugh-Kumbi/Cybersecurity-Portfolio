      "source": "## Task 1\n\nI converted the `employee_id` variable from a four-digit numeric format to a string format, storing the result in the same variable.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value\n\nemployee_id = 4186\n\n# Display the data type of `employee_id`\n\nprint(type(employee_id))\n\n# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string\n\nemployee_id = str(employee_id)\n\n# Display the data type of `employee_id` now\n\nprint(type(employee_id))\n```\n\n    <class 'int'>\n    <class 'str'>\n\n#### **Question 1**\n\n**What do you observe about the data type of `employee_id` the first\ntime it’s displayed? What do you observe about the data type of\n`employee_id` the second time it’s displayed (after the variable is\nreassigned)?**\n\nThe first time it is displayed, the data type of `employee_id` is\ninteger. The second time it is displayed (after the variable is\nreassigned), the data type of `employee_id` is string.\n\n## Task 2\n\nI wrote a conditional statement that checks if the length of the employee ID is less than five digits. If it is, the code displays a message indicating that the employee ID doesn't meet the new five-digit standard. \n\n``` python\n# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value\n\nemployee_id = 4186\n\n# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string\n\nemployee_id = str(employee_id)\n\n# Conditional statement that displays a message if the employee ID length is less than 5 digits\n\nif len(employee_id) < 5:\n    print(\"This employee ID has less than five digits. It does not meet length requirements.\")\n    \n```\n\n    This employee ID has less than five digits. It does not meet length requirements.\n\n## Task 3\n\nI wrote an `if` statement that checks if the length of the `employee_id` is less than five digits. If the condition is `True`, I used string concatenation to add `\"E\"` in front of the existing four-digit `employee_id` to make it a five-character employee ID. After updating the employee ID, I displayed it again.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `employee_id` to a four digit number as an initial value\n\nemployee_id = 4186\n\n# Reassign `employee_id` to the same value but in the form of a string\n\nemployee_id = str(employee_id)\n\n# Display the `employee_id` as it currently stands\n\nprint(employee_id)\n\n# Conditional statement that updates the `employee_id` if its length is less than 5 digits\n\nif len(employee_id) < 5:\n    employee_id = \"E\" + employee_id\n\n# Display the `employee_id` after the update\n\nprint(employee_id)\n```\n\n    4186\n    E4186\n\n## Task 4\n\nI extracted the fourth character from the `device_id` string using indexing. In Python, strings are zero-indexed, meaning that the first character is at position 0. To get the fourth character, I used the index `3`.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters\n\ndevice_id = \"r262c36\"\n\n# Extract the fourth character in `device_id` and display it\n\nprint(device_id[3])\n```\n\n    2\n\n## Task 5\n\nI extracted the first through the third characters from the `device_id` string using slicing. In Python, I used the slice notation `device_id[:3]`, which takes characters from index `0` up to (but not including) index `3`. \n\n``` python\n# Assign `device_id` to a string that contains alphanumeric characters\n\ndevice_id = \"r262c36\"\n\n# Extract the first through the third characters in `device_id` and display the result\n\ndevice_id[0:3]\n```\n\n    'r26'\n\n## Task 6\n\nI extracted the protocol and the `://` characters from the URL by using string slicing. Given that the protocol is always `https` followed by `://`, I used the slice notation to capture these first parts of the URL. \n\n``` python\n# Assign `url` to a specific URL\n\nurl = \"https://exampleURL1.com\"\n\n# Extract the protocol of `url` along with the syntax following it, display the result\n\nprint(url[0:8])\n```\n\n    https://\n\n## Task 7\n\nI used the `.index()` method to find the index where the domain extension `.com` starts in the given URL. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `url` to a specific URL\n\nurl = \"https://exampleURL1.com\"\n\n# Display the index where the domain extension \".com\" is located in `url`\n\nprint(url.index(\".com\"))\n```\n\n    19\n\n## Task 8\n\nI stored the index of the domain extension `.com` from the URL in a variable called `ind`, using the `.index()` method. This will help me track the position where the domain extension starts in the URL.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `url` to a specific URL\n\nurl = \"https://exampleURL1.com\"\n\n# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of \".com\" in `url`\n\nind = url.index(\".com\")\n```\n\n## Task 9\n\nI used string slicing to extract the domain extension from the URL. The result was `\".com\"`, as expected.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `url` to a specific URL\n\nurl = \"https://exampleURL1.com\"\n\n# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of \".com\" in `url`\n\nind = url.index(\".com\")\n\n# Extract the domain extension in `url` and display it\n\nprint(url[ind:ind+4])\n```\n\n    .com\n\n#### **Question 2**\n\n**What does this code output and why?**\n\nThis code outputs the domain name `.com` by first saving the starting\nposition of the domain name in the `ind` variable and then extracting 4\nconsecutive characters from `url` starting from the saved position.\n\n## Task 10\n\nFinally, extract the website name from the given URL using string\nslicing and the `ind` variable that you defined earlier. In the given\nURL, the website name is `\"exampleURL1\"`. Be sure to replace the\n`### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following\ncell.\n\n``` python\n# Assign `url` to a specific URL\n\nurl = \"https://exampleURL1.com\"\n\n# Assign `ind` to the output of applying `.index()` to `url` in order to extract the starting index of \".com\" in `url`\n\nind = url.index(\".com\")\n\n# Extract the website name in `url` and display it\n\nprint(url[8:ind])\n```\n\n    exampleURL1\n\nThe starting index should be set to `8`, since this is the position\nafter the protocol and the `://` syntax ends and where the website name\nbegins. The ending index should be set to the position where the `.com`\ndomain name begins.\n\n</details>\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**What are your key takeaways from this lab?** \\* Strings are\ninstrumental in storing important, security-related data, such as device\nIDs and URLs. \\* String concatenation allows you to easily combine\ninformation in a string with the information stored in another string.\n\\* String slicing is a powerful technique that enables you to extract\nany subsection of a string. \\* Python has many functions and methods\nthat help analysts work with string values, as well as data that they\nwant to convert to string format. \\* The `type()` function returns the\ndata type of its input. \\* The `str()` function converts the input\nobject into a string. For example, when called on an integer, `str()`\nreturns that integer value converted to a string. \\* The `len()`\nfunction returns the number of elements in an object. When called on a\nstring, `len()` returns the number of characters in that string. \\* The\n`.index()` method finds the first occurrence of the input in a string\nand returns its location. It provides the index where the substring\nbegins.",
