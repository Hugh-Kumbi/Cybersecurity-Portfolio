The elements of both lists were synchronized, meaning the user at index `0` in `approved_users` was associated with the device at index `0` in `approved_devices`. This synchronization allowed me to verify if a username and device ID matched.\n\nFirst, I ran the provided code to observe the output as-is, which helped me understand how indices in lists work. Next, I replaced each `0` with a different index in the code and re-ran the cell. By doing this, I explored how changing the index impacted the output, reinforcing my understanding of list indexing.",

To achieve this, I wrote a conditional statement that checked two conditions:\n\n1. If the `username` was an element of the `approved_users list`.\n2. If the `device_id` at the same index as `username` in the `approved_devices` list matched the `device_id` entered.\n\nI used the logical operator `and` to combine these conditions. When both conditions evaluated to `True`, I displayed a message confirming that the `username` was approved and another message verifying that the user had their assigned device.\n\nThis step ensured that the system validated both the identity of the user and the correctness of their assigned device.",

The outer conditional handled the case when the `username` was approved and when it was not. The inner conditional, placed inside the first `if` statement, handled the case where the `username` was approved, and it checked whether the `device_id` was correct. If the `device_id` was incorrect, the inner conditional would address that as well.\n\nTo finish the task, I defined a function named `login` that took two parameters: `username` and `device_id`.
