# Capturing and Filtering Network Traffic with Tcpdump

## Proposed Resolution

### Task 1: Identifying Network Interfaces

1. In this task, I had to identify the network interfaces that can be used to capture network packet data.
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo ifconfig`:

![sudo ifconfig](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b1d6039-c2bd-418d-a143-51af460c2179)

**Note:** The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the `eth` prefix.

2. I then used the `tcpdump` command to identify the interface options available for packet capture.
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo tcpdump -D`:

![sudo tcpdump -D](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f80a5da6-f6a1-4b8d-ab95-47b3d17309e0)

**Note:** The command in the image above allows the identification of which network interfaces are available. This may be useful on systems that do not include the `ifconfig` command. In addition, l used the `eth0` as the interface for capturing network packet data.

### Task 2: Inspecting the Network Traffic of a Network Interface with Tcpdump

1. I then used `tcpdump` to filter live network packet traffic from the `eth0` interface.
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5`:

![sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ada81c6-0c09-4dee-a030-e664e920c3ed)

The command in the image above will run tcpdump with the following options:

* `-i eth0`: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
* `-v`: Display detailed packet data.
* `c5`: Capture 5 packets of data.

Now, let's take a detailed look at the packet information that this command has returned.

The packet traffic data returned from the `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5` command is the following:

![Detailed look at the packet information](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ddc3b2d-d64d-4013-88bc-36f351d97b05)

***Note:** The specific details returned, such as system names, ports, and checksums, will definitely be different depending on each system.*

#### Exploring Network Packet Details 

In this example, I’ll identify some of the properties that `tcpdump` outputs for the packet capture data I’ve just seen.

1. In the example data below at the start of the packet output, `tcpdump` reported that it was listening on the `eth0` interface, and it provided information on the link type and the capture size in bytes:

![The start of the packet output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2ef84fe-b5d4-4735-91b0-0dda271cdba6)
 
2. On the next line, the first field is the packet's `timestamp`, followed by the protocol type, `IP`:

![The packet's timestamp, followed by the protocol type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66e39237-74ec-4c7d-9cb2-8e21444b95ee)

3. The verbose option, `-v`, has provided more details about the IP packet fields, such as `TOS`, `TTL`, `offset`, `flags`, internal protocol type (in this case, `TCP (6)`), and the length of the outer IP packet in `bytes`:

![The verbose option, -v, has provided more details about the IP packet fields](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a532cd9-14ae-487b-8138-cd224002e835)

**The following is an overview of the properties that relate to the IP network packets above:**

##### i. TOS (Type of Service): `0x0`

**Explanation:** 
* The `0x0` value indicates that the `TOS` field is set to its default (no special `QoS` marking or priority applied).

**Implications:**
  * No differentiated service (`DSCP`) or congestion notification (`ECN`) is enabled.
  * The packet does not request priority handling or special network services.
 
##### ii. TTL (Time to Live): `64`

**Explanation:**
* The initial TTL value is `64`, which is commonly used by modern operating systems (e.g., Linux).

**Behavior:**
  * Each router the packet traverses will decrement the `TTL` by `1`.
  * If the `TTL` reaches `0`, the packet is discarded, and an `ICMP` "Time Exceeded" message is sent to the sender.

**Typical Range:**
  * `TTL` values vary by OS: `64` (Linux/Unix), 128 (Windows), `255` (some network devices).

##### iii. ID (Identification): `31418`

**Explanation:**
* This `16-bit` field is used to uniquely identify fragments of a single `IP` packet.

**Relevance:**
  * If the packet is fragmented, all fragments will have the same `ID` to allow proper reassembly.
  * If fragmentation is not required (like in this case), it still contains a unique value.

##### iv. Offset: `0`

**Explanation:** 
* A value of `0` in the Fragment Offset field indicates this packet is not a fragment or is the first fragment.

**Behavior:**
* Used with the `Flags` field to determine the position of fragments in the original data stream.

##### v. Flags: `[DF]`

**Explanation:** 
* The `[DF]` (Don't Fragment) flag is set.

**Implications:**
* The packet must not be fragmented. If it exceeds the `MTU` (Maximum Transmission Unit) of a link, it will be discarded, and an `ICMP` "Fragmentation Needed" message will be sent back to the sender.
* This is useful for protocols that cannot tolerate fragmentation, such as `Path MTU` Discovery.

##### vi. Protocol: `TCP (6)`

**Explanation:** 
* The Protocol field indicates the type of payload carried by the `IP` packet.

**Value of `6`:** 
* Specifies that the encapsulated payload is a **TCP segment**.

**Other Common Protocol Values:**
* `1`: `ICMP` (Internet Control Message Protocol)
* `17`: `UDP` (User Datagram Protocol)

##### vii. Length: `125` 

**Explanation:** 
* This is the total length of the IP packet, measured in bytes, including both the header and the payload.

**Header and Payload:**
* If the IP header is the standard minimum size (20 bytes), then:
  
  **Payload Length = Total Length − Header Length = 125−20 = 105 bytes.**
* The payload in this case is likely a `TCP` segment with `105 bytes` of data.

**Summary Table:**
| Field | Value | Meaning |
| :-: | :-: | :- |
| **TOS** | `0x0` | Default service, no QoS or ECN |
| **TTL** | `64` | 64 hops remaining before expiration |
| **ID** | `31418` | Unique identifier for this IP packet |
| **Offset** | `0` | Packet is not fragmented |
| **Flags** | `[DF]` | Don't Fragment; packet must not fragment |
| **Protocol** | `TCP (6)` | Encapsulated protocol is TCP |
| **Length** | `125` | Total IP packet size in bytes |

***Note:** This packet is a typical TCP segment, not fragmented, with no special service or priority applied, originating from a system with a default TTL of 64.*

4. In the next section, the data shows the systems that are communicating with each other:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b09a6be5-4d83-4fdf-82e6-aa27546a491d)

By default, `tcpdump` will convert IP addresses into names, as in the screenshot. The name of my Linux virtual machine, is also included in the command prompt, it appears here as the source for one packet and the destination for the second packet. In relation to live data, the name will be a different set of letters and numbers.

The direction of the arrow (>) indicates the direction of the traffic flow in this packet. Each system name includes a suffix with the port number (.5000 in the screenshot), which is used by the source and the destination systems for this packet.

5. The remaining data filters the header data for the inner `TCP` packet:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e82e1463-dfab-4283-a500-094318e8c8ff)

The **flags** field identifies `TCP flags`. In this case, the **P** represents the `push flag` and the **period** indicates it's an `ACK flag`. This means the packet is pushing out data.

The next field is the `TCP checksum value`, which is used for detecting errors in the data.

This section also includes the **sequence** and **acknowledgment** numbers, the **window size**, and the **length** of the **inner TCP packet** in bytes.

### Task 3: Capturing Network Traffic with Tcpdump

**In this task, I used tcpdump to save the captured network data to a packet capture file.**

In the previous command, I used `tcpdump` to stream all network traffic. Here, I used a filter and other `tcpdump` configuration options to save a small sample that contains only web (`TCP port 80`) network packet data.

1. Capturing packet data into a file called capture.pcap:
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &`:

![sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342506e2-5fa7-401a-a3e1-6072dc8ac889)

I had to press the **ENTER** key to get a command prompt back after running the above command.

**This command runs `tcpdump` in the background with the following options:**

* -`i eth0`: Capture data from the eth0 interface.
* -`nn`: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
* -`c9`: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
port 80: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
* -`w capture.pcap`: Save the captured data to the named file.
* `&`: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.

***Note:** This command runs in the background, but some output text will appeared on my terminal. The text didn't affect the commands when I proceeded with the steps for the rest of the lab.*

2. I then used the `curl` command to generate some HTTP (port 80) traffic.
    * The The command to complete this step is `curl opensource.google.com`:

![curl opensource.google.com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7e34f2-4ce1-49ac-9ae2-2a05f8b266a8)

***Note:** When the `curl` command is used like this to open a website, it generates some HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic that can be captured.*

3. In order to verify that packet data has been captured the the command `ls -l capture.pcap` can be used.
    * The The command to complete this step is `ls -l capture.pcap`:

![ls -l capture.pcap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c883b1e2-617c-4005-bab7-32bcf1f0ca3a)

***Note:** The "Done" in the output indicates that the packet was captured.*

### Task 4: Filter the Captured Packet Data

**In this task, I used `tcpdump` to filter data from the packet capture file I saved previously.**

1. I started by filtering the packet header data from the capture.pcap capture file.
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v`:

![sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1bd55d-6964-4880-8fd0-60bb0c8c4e8b)

This command will run tcpdump with the following options:

* `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
* `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
* `-v`: Display detailed packet data.

Given that I want to make sure that `tcpdump` does not perform name lookups of either IP addresses or ports, I had to specify the `-nn` switch again here because this can alert threat actors.

This returns output data as shown below:

![Specifying the -nn switch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2abac97-c417-4f73-b1df-1917b7c0d04b)

***Note:** In the image provided above, we can see the IP packet information along with information about the data that the packet contains.*

2. I then filtered the extended packet data from the capture.pcap capture file.
    * The The command to complete this step is `sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X`:

![sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab4848c0-9b3c-4969-af98-db26c24cc25b)

This command will run tcpdump with the following options:

* `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
* `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
* `-X`: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.

This returns output data as shown below:

![extended packet data from the capture.pcap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f5193a5-f78e-4adc-b863-43efb2c4d42d)

***Note:** Hexadecimal, also known as hex or base 16, uses 16 symbols to represent values, including the digits 0-9 and letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character encoding standard that uses a set of characters to represent text in digital form.*

### Outcomes 

As a result of completing this activity, I have gained practical experience in:

Identifying network interfaces.
Using the tcpdump command to capture network data for inspection.
Interpreting the information that tcpdump outputs about a packet.
Saving and loading packet data for later analysis.
I am now well-prepared to capture and analyze packets effectively.
