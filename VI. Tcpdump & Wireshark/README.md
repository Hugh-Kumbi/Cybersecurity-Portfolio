1.1  **Analyzing Network Traffic with Wireshark**

- In this lab activity, I explored network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer.

I worked with a sample packet capture file to inspect and interpret packet data. By applying filters within Wireshark, I was able to focus on specific network traffic relevant to security investigations, identifying patterns and key details. This exercise highlighted the importance of tools like Wireshark in examining complex network data and streamlining analysis for more effective security operations.
