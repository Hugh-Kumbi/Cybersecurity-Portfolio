# Securing Networks: Leveraging Tcpdump and Wireshark for Incident Response

This folder contains exercises, solutions, and supporting materials focused on managing assets, threats, and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. It highlights the use of tools like Tcpdump and Wireshark to analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, and respond to cybersecurity incidents, emphasizing practical applications within the incident response lifecycle.

## Contents

1.1  **Analyzing Network Traffic with Wireshark**

- In this lab activity, I explored network traffic analysis using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer.

I worked with a sample packet capture file to inspect and interpret packet data. By applying filters within Wireshark, I was able to focus on specific network traffic relevant to security investigations, identifying patterns and key details. This exercise highlighted the importance of tools like Wireshark in examining complex network data and streamlining analysis for more effective security operations.
  
1.2  **Capturing and Filtering Network Traffic with Tcpdump**

- In this lab activity, I used `tcpdump`, a command-line packet analyzer, to capture and filter network traffic in a Linux environment.

I performed tasks to capture packet data into a packet capture (p-cap) file and then analyzed its contents to focus on specific traffic types. This exercise reinforced my understanding of network interfaces and the basic concepts needed to examine network traffic for security purposes.
