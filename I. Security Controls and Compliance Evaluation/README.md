**1.1 Controls and Compliance Assessment:** 
* In part one of this activity, I conducted an internal security audit to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures and identify potential risks or vulnerabilities that could impact the organizationâ€™s business continuity and critical assets. The audit process helped ensure that security checks were properly implemented to monitor for threats, assess potential risks, and detect vulnerabilities that could affect the organization's overall security posture. By conducting this audit, I was able to identify areas for improvement and make recommendations for strengthening the organization's security defenses.
